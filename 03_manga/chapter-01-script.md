## Page 1

### Panel 1 — Wide

**Action:** Establishing shot. London skyline, year 3031. Massive tower structures rise above an ocean that covers everything below. Hover vehicles streak between buildings. A pink-orange dawn sky. The city is vertical — bridges, walkways, and platforms connect the towers at dizzying heights.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Set the scale immediately. This is NOT modern London — it's a megacity above water. Think Blade Runner meets flooded Venice. Show the water level far below, with the tops of old landmarks (Big Ben's clock face, the tip of the Shard) barely visible above the waterline.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Big Ben's clock face (partially submerged, with water lapping at the 6 o'clock mark) shows 9:00. The bell is chiming. A walkway runs past it at the level of the clock face.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** BONG BONG BONG
**Notes:** The clock is a relic — still functioning but half-drowned. Contrast old London with the futuristic towers behind it.

### Panel 3 — Medium-Wide

**Action:** Spyke sprints along a crowded elevated walkway in Westminster. His huge broadsword swings wildly from side to side on his back, forcing commuters to dodge. His red bandana trails behind him, white cloak billowing. Spiky ginger hair whipping in the wind. Green eyes focused ahead. He's weaving through a crowd of people in futuristic work clothes heading to their jobs.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE (thought): *Shit. I'm gonna be late...*
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** First appearance of Spyke — make it dynamic. The broadsword should look absurdly large for someone his size. Commuters reacting with annoyance/surprise sells the comedy and the weapon's scale.

---

## Page 2

### Panel 1 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke's face in profile, mid-sprint. Wind hitting him. His green eyes are sharp, determined. The red bandana flutters behind him. A bead of sweat on his brow.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Clean character intro shot. This is the face the reader needs to remember. Make the green eyes vivid.

### Panel 2 — Wide

**Action:** Spyke spots a gap between two buildings — a narrow alleyway shortcut. He cuts hard left, leaving the main walkway and slipping through the crowd into the alley.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE (thought): *The shortcut... 23 seconds.*
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Show his tactical thinking — he knows this route by heart. The alley should look tight and shadowed compared to the bright main walkway.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke emerges from the alley onto a small grassy area — a pocket park on an elevated platform between towers. Three punks are sitting on a bench, dressed in black, smoking. They notice Spyke immediately.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** The park is a rare green space in this vertical city. The punks should look like street-level thugs — young, cocky, armed with short blades visible at their hips.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** The punks stare at Spyke, sizing him up. The biggest punk in the center leans forward with a grin. Spyke walks past them, eyes forward, not breaking stride.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Tension. Silent panel. Let the art do the work — eyes tracking Spyke like predators.

---

## Page 3

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** The lead punk calls out to Spyke from behind. Spyke doesn't stop walking. His back is to us — the broadsword dominates the frame.
**Dialogue:**
- PUNK 1: "Hey... that's a pretty cool weapon on yo' back."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** The punk's tone is casual but probing. Spyke's body language says "don't care."

### Panel 2 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke's eyes from the side. Cold. Ignoring. Walking.
**Dialogue:**
- PUNK 1 (off-panel): "Is that just for show, or do you know how to use it?"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Minimal. The silence IS the answer.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** The lead punk appears directly behind Spyke, grabbing his shoulder. Spyke's hand instantly snaps to the katana at his hip. His expression goes from cold to lethal in a frame.
**Dialogue:**
- PUNK 1: "I'm talking to you!"
- SPYKE: "Don't touch me."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Speed contrast — the punk lunged fast but Spyke's hand was faster. His fingers on the katana hilt should be the visual hook. The other two punks flanking behind, giggling.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke has swivelled to face them. His hand is on his katana, not drawn yet. The punks fan out, drawing short swords. The biggest punk hangs back with a knowing grin.
**Dialogue:**
- PUNK 1: "I asked you a qu—"
- SPYKE: "I don't have time for this. Get lost!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke's fury echoing across the park. His voice carries weight. The punks are taken aback for a beat.

---

## Page 4

### Panel 1 — Medium-Wide

**Action:** Two of the punks rush Spyke from different angles. The big punk stays back, arms crossed, watching. Spyke draws his katana in a fluid motion, blocking the first attack.
**Dialogue:**
- PUNK 2: "Come on, let's play..."
- SPYKE (thought): *I don't have time for this.*
**SFX:** CLANG
**Notes:** Start the action. Show Spyke's defensive stance — he's not attacking yet, just blocking. Annoyed, not threatened.

### Panel 2 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke pushes the first punk away with his katana, then pivots to block the second attack from the other angle. Sparks fly.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** SHING — CLANG
**Notes:** Two beats in one panel — push, pivot, block. Speed lines on Spyke's rotation.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke settles into a combat stance, katana held one-handed. The two punks are on the ground, groaning. Quick fight. The big punk watches, unfazed.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE (thought): *Hmph... guess I could do with a warm up.*
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke barely broke a sweat. The two smaller punks are done. This was a tutorial — show it being trivially easy for him.

> **[PLAYER DECISION POINT]** — *1st Battle tutorial: Spyke vs 2 punks (katana)*

---

## Page 5

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** The big punk steps forward, drawing his own broadsword — it's large, matching Spyke's in scale. He grins.
**Dialogue:**
- PUNK 1: "I asked if you could use that big sword on your back!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** The challenge. This punk has been waiting to see the broadsword. His own sword establishes he's a cut above the other two.

### Panel 2 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke's expression. A flicker of interest for the first time — then he reaches back and grips his broadsword's hilt. One corner of his mouth twitches.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "Hmph!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** The smirk. Spyke doesn't hate fighting — he hates wasting time. A worthy opponent is different.

### Panel 3 — Wide

**Action:** Spyke swings the massive broadsword in a devastating arc. The big punk blocks but is sent skidding backward from the force. Cracks form in the ground beneath his feet. Energy crackles along Spyke's blade — the faintest hint of Plasma.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** KRAAAANG
**Notes:** Show the WEIGHT. This is a Plasma-infused broadsword. When it connects, reality shudders. The punk's block should look like it nearly broke his arms.

> **[PLAYER DECISION POINT]** — *2nd Battle tutorial: weapon switch to broadsword*

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke sheathes his sword. The big punk is on the ground, defeated. Spyke turns and walks away without looking back.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE (thought): *I'm gonna miss the train...*
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Business done. Move on. Spyke doesn't gloat.

---

## Page 6

### Panel 1 — Wide

**Action:** From behind, Spyke walks away down the path. In the background, the three punks lie defeated on the grass.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Quiet beat. Moment to breathe.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** The three knocked-out punks suddenly vanish in puffs of dark smoke. Where their bodies were, nothing remains.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** POOF POOF POOF
**Notes:** This is the first hint that something supernatural is happening. The smoke should be dark, almost black, with an oily quality.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** A tall hooded figure steps out from the shadows of the alleyway. Black cloak, broadsword in one hand. Face completely hidden. The figure stares in Spyke's direction.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** First appearance of Hood (Morkain). Silhouette only. Menacing, still, watching. The reader should feel the danger even though nothing happens. Dark aura emanating from the figure.

### Panel 4 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke mid-stride, suddenly freezing. A chill running down his spine — we see it as a cold visual effect crawling up his back. He glances over his shoulder.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE (thought): *...What was that?*
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke's instincts are sharp. He felt something. But when he looks back...

### Panel 5 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke's POV — the park is empty. The punks gone, no hooded figure. Just the wind rustling the grass.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Nothing there. But the reader knows better. Spyke shakes it off and keeps moving.

---

## Page 7

### Panel 1 — Wide (Establishing)

**Action:** Cutscene transition. The 9:27 train streaks through a tube between two massive tower structures. Hover-rail system. Through the windows we can see passengers. The ocean far below.
**Dialogue:**
- (narration): *The 9:27 from Kings Cross. The only train to the Formican Army base.*
**SFX:** WHOOOOSH
**Notes:** Time skip — Spyke made the train. Show the futuristic transit system. The train hovers on magnetic rails between the towers.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Inside the train. Spyke sits alone, broadsword propped against the seat next to him (nobody dares sit near it). He stares out the window, arms crossed. Other candidates — young people with various weapons — sit scattered around the carriage.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke isolates himself by default. The empty seats around him say everything about how people react to that broadsword — and to him.

### Panel 3 — Wide

**Action:** The Formican Army base comes into view through the train windows. It's enormous — a military complex with a massive pyramid structure at its center. Airships dock at its edges. Soldiers and candidates stream toward it from multiple train platforms.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Scale shot. The pyramid is the visual centerpiece — ancient-looking but with modern military infrastructure surrounding it. Flags with the Formican Army insignia everywhere.

---

## Page 8

### Panel 1 — Wide

**Action:** Spyke walks through the base entrance. Stewards in Formican blue uniforms direct crowds of candidates. The interior is sleek, militaristic — metal corridors, holographic signage, the pyramid visible through glass walls.
**Dialogue:**
- (narration): *The Formican Army. Drafted to fight the monsters that appear where Plasma concentrates. The planet Terra entered our solar system, and everything changed.*
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** World-building through narration boxes. Keep it brief — the visuals tell most of the story. Show the diversity of candidates — all young, all armed.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke at the registration desk. A bored registrar looks at a holographic screen. Spyke's face is impatient.
**Dialogue:**
- REGISTRAR: "You'll be paired with two others. Your pass or fail depends on teamwork."
- SPYKE: "I don't need to be paired with anyone. I can do this myself."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke's isolation established through action. He's not just quiet — he actively rejects cooperation.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** The registrar is unmoved by Spyke's attitude. Professional, flat.
**Dialogue:**
- REGISTRAR: "Teamwork is paramount to field work. You're free to explore until test time."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Bureaucracy doesn't care about your attitude. The registrar has seen a hundred Spykes today.

> **[PLAYER DECISION POINT]** — *Free exploration of Formican base. Practice battles, learn sword art basics.*

---

## Page 9

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke is in a waiting area, warming up — stretching, doing practice swings with his katana in controlled arcs. He's focused, in his own world.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Show his discipline. He's rough around the edges socially but dead serious about combat.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** June walks up to Spyke. She's blonde, sporty, confident posture. Shortsword at her hip, pistol holster on her thigh, one magician glove on her left hand. She's tying her hair back as she approaches.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Are you in for this slot?"
- SPYKE: "Yes."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** First appearance of June. She looks capable and well-equipped — contrast with Spyke's minimal gear (just blades). Her energy is open where his is closed.

### Panel 3 — Close-up

**Action:** June extends a hand with a bright smile. Spyke gives her a single glance — then looks away and continues warming up.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Great! My name is June. I look forward to—"
- SPYKE: "Spyke."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** He cuts her off. Doesn't shake her hand. June's expression shifts from friendly to taken aback.

### Panel 4 — Close-up

**Action:** June's face — a mix of irritation and forced composure. Thought bubble.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE (thought): *He must have been that guy yelling earlier... Great. How did I get stuck with him?*
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Her internal monologue is expressive where Spyke's is terse. This contrast is the foundation of their dynamic.

### Panel 5 — Small inset

**Action:** June glances at Spyke's back as he warms up. She notices the broadsword's size. Slight widening of her eyes.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE (thought): *...He does look strong though.*
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Grudging respect. Plant the seed early.

## Page 10

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** A dry, confident voice calls from down the corridor. Draster walks toward them — dark brown skin, black and silver hair, soft brown eyes. Slim. Navy jacket-style suit-robe. Hands in his pockets. Wearing leather Plasma Gloves on both hands.
**Dialogue:**
- DRASTER: "Yo, you guys here for the exam?"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** First appearance of Draster. He's the opposite of Spyke's intensity — relaxed, at ease. His gloves should be visible even with hands in pockets.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Draster walks up to both of them. Polite nod. June immediately brightens up, grateful for normal social interaction.
**Dialogue:**
- DRASTER: "My name is Draster. Pleased to meet you."
- JUNE: "Hey Draster! I'm June and this is Spyke! Pleased to meet you!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** June's energy jumps when she has someone to talk to. She introduces Spyke for him because she already knows he won't do it himself.

### Panel 3 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke gives Draster a flat glare. Silent. Continues warming up.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "..."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Empty speech bubble with "..." — Spyke's signature non-response. Draster is unruffled.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** All three standing together for the first time. Spyke slightly apart from the other two. June's arms crossed, disappointed. Draster calm, hands in pockets.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "Let's just get this over with."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** First shot of the trio together. Spyke is literally apart — body language gap. This composition will mirror a later shot where they stand together as a real team.

---

## Page 11

### Panel 1 — Wide

**Action:** The trio enters the examination room through a door behind the reception counter. The moment they step through, the scene transforms — they're standing at the edge of a massive greenhouse-like dome. Lush tropical trees, grass, and a dome ceiling painted like a sunset sky. It feels like stepping into another world.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Visual shock. The transition from sterile military corridor to this living jungle should be jarring and beautiful. Foreshadows Terra without the reader knowing it.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** The trio reacts to the dome. June's eyes are wide with wonder. Draster observes analytically. Spyke scans for threats.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Whoa..."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Each character reacts differently to the same stimulus — this is character work through reaction shots.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** An intercom crackles from hidden speakers in the dome ceiling.
**Dialogue:**
- INTERCOM: "Your mission: defeat the Ravage and obtain the gold ring it carries."
- JUNE: "And where is this Ravage?!"
- DRASTER: "That would be too easy..."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Draster's tactical mind already working. June wants direct answers. Classic trio dynamics from the start.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke has already spotted a trail path to the right and started walking toward it. No announcement, no discussion. June and Draster exchange a glance and follow.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke leads through action, not words. He doesn't wait for consensus. Silent panel — let the composition speak.

---

## Page 12

### Panel 1 — Wide

**Action:** The trio moves through the dome jungle. Dense vegetation, strange tropical plants, filtered sunset light through the dome ceiling. Spyke is point, June middle, Draster rear.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** Ambient jungle sounds — CHIRP CHIRP, rustling leaves
**Notes:** Build atmosphere before the boss. Show them navigating as a unit even though they're strangers. Natural formation.

> **[PLAYER DECISION POINT]** — *Player controls exploration through the dome. Character switch tutorial. Random monster encounters.*

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** The path opens into a clearing. In the center, a massive beast — the Ravage. It's behemoth-like, quadrupedal, with thick armored hide and a gold ring pierced through its nose. It senses them and turns, growling.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** GRRRRR
**Notes:** The Ravage should fill the panel — show its mass. The gold ring glints. It's not intelligent, just powerful and angry.

### Panel 3 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke grins slightly. His hand goes to his broadsword.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "So you're the Ravage, huh?"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** A hint of excitement. Spyke lives for this.

---

## Page 13

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke draws his broadsword and steps forward, away from the group. His stance is aggressive, solo.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "You two stay back. I'll handle this."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Here it is — the lone wolf problem. He's actively shutting out his team in a teamwork exam.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** June steps forward, furious. She draws her shortsword. Behind her, Draster shrugs and begins pulling his Plasma Gloves tight.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Are you kidding?! We need to work together!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** June is the one who calls it out. She's the emotional catalyst that forces change.

### Panel 3 — Wide (Action)

**Action:** Spyke charges the Ravage head-on. The beast rears up. Spyke slashes at its chest — the sword bounces off the armored hide with a metallic clang. No damage.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** CLANG — THUD
**Notes:** His frontal assault fails. The armor is too thick. This is the stagger mechanic introduction — brute force alone doesn't work.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** June rolls her eyes and looks at Draster. They both sprint to flank the Ravage.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Grrr! Draster, let's go!"
- DRASTER: "Hmph... I guess we all need to be alive to pass."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Draster's line is dry humor. He's not angry, just pragmatic. June channels her frustration into action.

---

## Page 14

### Panel 1 — Wide (Action)

**Action:** Three-way assault on the Ravage. Spyke attacks from the front (drawing aggro), June circles to the side (fast, agile, using her Plasma shoes for quick bursts of movement), Draster hangs back casting — his Plasma Gloves glow as he sends a wind blast toward the Ravage's tail.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** WHOOSH — CRACK
**Notes:** Dynamic fight composition. Show three distinct fighting styles in one frame: strength (Spyke), speed (June), magic (Draster).

### Panel 2 — Close-up

**Action:** The Ravage's tail takes a direct hit from Draster's wind spell. The beast staggers — its legs buckle for a moment. Its armor plates separate slightly.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE (off-panel): "The tail! That's its weak point!"
**SFX:** CRACK
**Notes:** Stagger mechanic visualized. The armor plates shifting/separating shows the opening.

> **[PLAYER DECISION POINT]** — *Ravage boss battle. Exploit tail weakness to trigger stagger. June provides hints.*

### Panel 3 — Wide (Action)

**Action:** Spyke sees the opening. He rushes in with a massive overhead swing of his broadsword, bringing it down on the staggered Ravage. The impact sends a shockwave through the ground. Plasma energy crackles along the blade.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** KRAKOOOM
**Notes:** Full impact panel. Show the Plasma energy visually — blue/white crackling along the blade edge. The Ravage takes the full hit.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** The Ravage collapses, dissolving into Plasma dust. The gold ring falls to the ground with a clink. The dome jungle is suddenly quiet.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** clink
**Notes:** Quiet after chaos. The Plasma dust should look like glowing particles floating away — beautiful, not gruesome.

---

## Page 15

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke picks up the gold ring. Examines it. June and Draster catch their breath behind him.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "This is it, huh?"
- JUNE: "OK, we've got it — now let us out!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** June yells toward the ceiling, expecting the intercom to respond. Silence.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Seconds pass. No response. The trio exchanges looks. Draster breaks the silence.
**Dialogue:**
- DRASTER: "I guess we find the exit ourselves. Let's go back the way we came."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Draster is the practical one. Already planning the next move while the others wait.

### Panel 3 — Wide

**Action:** The trio retraces their steps through the dome jungle. The path looks subtly different — the lighting has shifted, the shadows are longer. Something is off but none of them can put a finger on it.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Visual unease. The dome is changing. Slightly different colors, slightly different arrangement of trees. The reader should feel "wrong" before the characters do.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** They arrive at where the entrance was — but the door is gone. Just a solid wall of vegetation and dome structure. Spyke puts his hand against it.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "Hmm? The door was here."
- DRASTER: "I thought so too. Did we take a wrong turn?"
- SPYKE: "No. It was here."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke's certainty. He doesn't question his own memory. The flat statement "No. It was here." — this is how he talks. No debate.

---

## Page 16

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** June looks around, agitated. Arms out in frustration.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Great... are we lost now?!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Her frustration is open, physical. She gestures big.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** A sudden gust of wind sweeps through the dome. The trio's hair and clothes whip violently. Draster shields his eyes. Spyke's hand goes to his sword.
**Dialogue:**
- DRASTER: "Wind? In here?"
**SFX:** WHOOOOSH
**Notes:** Indoor wind = impossible. This is the first sign of Hood's power. The wind should feel supernatural, not mechanical.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke's expression hardens. Eyes narrowing. Battle stance.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "Something is up. Stay alert. Don't get killed."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** His version of "be careful" — sounds like a threat, means he cares. Character voice.

### Panel 4 — Wide

**Action:** The wind intensifies. Through the swirling leaves and dust, a dark figure materializes — the hooded figure from the park, broadsword in one hand. Three punks flank either side of him. The same punks from before — or copies of them.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Hood's entrance should be cinematic — emerging from the wind itself. The punks are the same ones Spyke fought earlier (the reader should recognize them). Their eyes are blank, wrong.

---

## Page 17

### Panel 1 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke's eyes widen. Recognition. Then anger.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "It was you earlier."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** He connects the dots instantly. The park encounter. The chill on his spine. This is the same presence.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke points his katana at the hooded figure.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "Who are you?!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Demanding, not asking. Spyke doesn't do questions politely.

### Panel 3 — Wide (Action)

**Action:** Before Hood responds, the three punks rush the trio. They're faster this time, stronger — their movements are inhuman, jerky, like puppets on strings. The trio is forced into combat.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** The punks aren't natural. Show their movements as wrong — slightly too fast, slightly off-angle. These are monsters disguised as people (or puppets of Hood's power).

### Panel 4 — Medium (Action)

**Action:** June fires her pistol at one punk, Draster blasts another with a fire spell from his gloves, Spyke cuts through the third with his katana. The punks are dispatched — and dissolve into dark smoke, just like in the park.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** BANG — FWOOSH — SLASH
**Notes:** Quick, brutal. The trio works as a unit instinctively this time — the exam taught them. The smoke dissolving confirms: these were monsters, not people.

---

## Page 18

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** June, breathing hard. Draster, alert. They stare at where the punks dissolved.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "What's going on?!"
- SPYKE: "That guy attacked me earlier."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Information exchange. Fast. No time for lengthy explanations.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke faces Hood. Knuckles white on his katana. Rage building.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "What the hell are you?!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke's volume rising. His composure is cracking.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** Hood speaks for the first time. The voice comes from everywhere — resonating through the dome. The figure is perfectly still.
**Dialogue:**
- HOOD: "You will know soon enough."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Hood's speech balloon should look different from everyone else's — darker border, slightly different font/style to convey that deep, resonant, eerie voice.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** Hood tilts his head slightly. Something almost like amusement in his posture.
**Dialogue:**
- HOOD: "You've passed the test. Now it's time to go."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** "Passed the test" — Hood is claiming ownership of the exam. He's been testing them the entire time. This should disturb the reader.

---

## Page 19

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** June steps forward, fists clenched.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Is this part of the test?!"
- DRASTER: "I don't think so."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Draster's calm observation cuts through June's energy. He already knows this is wrong.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke's face, teeth gritted. Veins visible at his temple. The rage is boiling over.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "Answer me! What are you and what do you want?!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** His patience is gone. Everything about his body language says he's about to attack.

### Panel 3 — Close-up

**Action:** Hood. Just the lower half of the hooded face. A mouth, barely visible. One word.
**Dialogue:**
- HOOD: "Hmph..."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Dismissive. The most infuriating response possible to someone demanding answers. This is Morkain's personality — he doesn't explain himself.

### Panel 4 — Wide (Action)

**Action:** Spyke snaps. He charges Hood, broadsword drawn, roaring. The attack is pure rage — wild, powerful, uncontrolled. The panel should feel dangerous.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "RRAAAGH!!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Rage Mode trigger. This is Spyke losing control — not a calculated attack. The panel borders should become jagged/aggressive to reflect his mental state (per manga-script visual rules for Adrenaline Mode).

---

## Page 20

### Panel 1 — Wide (Action)

**Action:** Spyke swings his broadsword at Hood with devastating force. Hood blocks with one hand on his own broadsword — effortlessly. The impact creates a shockwave that cracks the ground, but Hood doesn't move an inch.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** KRAAANG
**Notes:** Power gap visualized. Spyke's full-force attack vs Hood's casual one-hand block. This tells the reader everything about the difference between them. Hood's feet haven't shifted.

> **[PLAYER DECISION POINT]** — *Battle with Hood. Rage Mode tutorial. Only rage-enhanced attacks do damage. Hood is overwhelmingly powerful. Player can win or lose — outcome is the same.*

### Panel 2 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke's eyes — they flash red for an instant. Adrenaline Mode activating. The panel style shifts — heavier inks, sharper lines, jagged panel border.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** First glimpse of Adrenaline Mode. The red eyes are the key visual. Don't overdo it yet — this is the seed. Just a flash, then it fades.

### Panel 3 — Medium (Action)

**Action:** Spyke attacks again, faster this time — the rage-enhanced speed catches Hood slightly off guard. A scratch appears on Hood's cloak. The first damage anyone has done.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** SLASH
**Notes:** A tiny victory. One scratch. But it matters — it means Hood can be touched. Plant this for later payoff.

### Panel 4 — Close-up

**Action:** Hood looks at the scratch on his cloak. Then back at Spyke. The darkness under the hood seems to deepen.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Silent assessment. Hood is studying Spyke. Interested, not threatened. This is important — Hood wanted to test Spyke specifically.

### Panel 1 — Wide (Action)

**Action:** Hood raises his empty hand. A massive blast of wind erupts from his palm, slamming into all three of them. June and Draster are blown backward like ragdolls. Spyke digs his sword into the ground to anchor himself but is still sliding back.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** WHOOOOOM
**Notes:** The power gap laid bare. One casual gesture from Hood ragdolls the whole party. This is the "you are nothing" moment.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** The trio is on their knees, battered. Spyke's broadsword is planted in the ground as a crutch. June is clutching her ribs. Draster's gloves are sparking but fading. They're beaten.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "Goddamnit... what are you..."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Exhaustion. Pain. They were at 100% and Hood brought them to nearly nothing with minimal effort. This is the power ceiling established.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** Hood stands over them. Untouched except for the scratch. Broadsword in one hand, other hand at his side. Speaking down to them.
**Dialogue:**
- HOOD: "Just call me... Hood."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** He answers the name question — nothing else. Minimal information. Maximum menace. The ellipsis in his speech should feel deliberate, like he chose the name in that moment.

## Page 22 [PAGE-TURN REVEAL]

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** The trio struggles. Spyke tries to stand, using his sword as a lever. June's face shows defiance through pain. Draster tries to speak but winces.
**Dialogue:**
- DRASTER: "Hey... what the hell..."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** They're not beaten in spirit, just in body. Show their determination even as they can barely move.

### Panel 2 — Close-up

**Action:** Hood raises his empty hand again. Wind begins swirling around the trio — not an attack, but a vortex. Leaves, dust, and light spiral around them.
**Dialogue:**
- HOOD: "Now it's time to go to Terra..."
**SFX:** WHOOOOSH (building)
**Notes:** The word "Terra" should hit like a bomb. The reader doesn't know what Terra is yet — but the characters do, and their reactions sell it.

### Panel 3 — Close-up

**Action:** June's face. Pure shock. Eyes wide, mouth open.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "WHAT?!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** June's reaction is the reader's reaction. Full-frame shock.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke drags himself to his feet, barely. One last desperate charge. He lifts his sword with everything he has left. The wind is pulling him away. His bandana whips violently.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "GODDAMNIT!!!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Last act of defiance. He won't go quietly. Even battered, even outmatched, Spyke fights. This defines his character more than any dialogue.

---

## Page 23 — SPLASH PAGE

### Panel 1 — Full Page

**Action:** The tornado of wind and dust engulfs the trio completely. Spyke's roar is silenced as all three are lifted off the ground and consumed by the vortex. Hood stands at the calm center, watching. The dome around them shatters — the sunset sky, the jungle trees, all fragmenting like broken glass as the power tears through reality.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** **SPLASH PAGE.** This is the moment the story leaves Earth. The dome shattering represents the world as the trio knew it breaking apart. Hood at the center — still, patient, in control. The trio's silhouettes visible within the storm. No dialogue. Let the image carry it.

## Page 24

### Panel 1 — Black

**Action:** Total darkness. A single heartbeat sound effect.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** ba-dump
**Notes:** Transition. The screen is black. One beat of silence between worlds.

### Panel 2 — Extreme Close-up

**Action:** Spyke's hand, limp on strands of blue grass. The grass is vivid blue — immediately wrong, alien. His fingers twitch.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** The blue grass is the first visual of Terra. Don't show the sky yet — build to it. Hand on blue grass is the hook.

### Panel 3 — Close-up

**Action:** Spyke's face, cheek pressed to the blue grass. His eyes flutter open. Groggy. Confused. His vision is blurred.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Vulnerability. Spyke is rarely seen this way. He's disoriented, guard down.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke pushes himself up to a crouch. His broadsword is lying across from him on the grass. June and Draster are visible in the background, just beginning to stir.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Building the reveal. The reader can see the blue grass but still hasn't seen the sky or the full environment.

## Page 25 — DOUBLE-PAGE SPREAD (Pages 25-26)

### Panel 1 — Full Double Spread

**Action:** Spyke stands. The camera pulls back to reveal TERRA in full panoramic glory. Blue grass stretching to the horizon. A pink sky with cotton-candy clouds. Blue-leafed trees dotting the landscape. In the sky, a massive planet — Earth — hangs like an enormous moon, its oceans and clouds clearly visible. The air looks thick, almost visible, with heat-haze quality.

June is sitting up behind Spyke, staring at the sky. Draster is rising to his feet, hand shielding his eyes.

The world is beautiful, alien, and vast.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "...That's Earth."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** **DOUBLE-PAGE SPREAD.** This is THE reveal of Terra. It must be breathtaking. Blue grass, pink sky, blue-leafed trees — these are the visual rules that define every outdoor Terra scene going forward. Earth in the sky is the confirmation. Spyke's two words say everything. Let the art carry the emotional weight.

## Page 27

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** June is on her knees on the blue grass, staring up at Earth in the sky. Her face shifts from wonder to dread.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Shiiiit..."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** The reality setting in. They're not on Earth anymore. They're stranded.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** Silence between the three. Long shot — they're small figures in the vast alien landscape. Alone.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** A moment of quiet horror. Three teenagers on an alien planet. No allies, no information, no way home.

### Panel 3 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke picks up his sword and sheathes it. His face is set — whatever he's feeling, he's already moving past it.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "We need to get back."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Spyke processes by moving forward. He doesn't dwell. His coping mechanism is action.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** June snaps. She rounds on Spyke, finger pointing.
**Dialogue:**
- JUNE: "Who the hell was that guy, Spyke?!"
- SPYKE: "I don't know."
- JUNE: "Why was he following you?! Did you not think to investigate before—"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** June channels fear into anger. She needs someone to blame. Spyke is the obvious target. The argument is building.

---

## Page 28

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke turns on June, bristling. They're face to face, neither backing down.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "What?! You blaming this on me?!"
- JUNE: "He was after YOU! Now we're on another planet because of you!"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Real conflict. Neither is wrong — June's frustration is valid, and Spyke couldn't have known. But fear makes people irrational.

### Panel 2 — Medium

**Action:** The argument intensifies. They're shouting at each other. In the background, Draster watches with arms crossed, patience wearing thin.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "I couldn't even sense the guy until the exam!"
- JUNE: "Yeah, but you must have known—"
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Overlapping arguments. The speech balloons should crowd the panel, creating visual noise.

### Panel 3 — Wide

**Action:** Draster steps between them, arms out. His face is stern — the first time we've seen him anything other than calm.
**Dialogue:**
- DRASTER: "ENOUGH."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Impact. Draster's voice silences both of them. The peacemaker shows authority when needed.

### Panel 4 — Medium

**Action:** Draster faces both of them. Firm, measured.
**Dialogue:**
- DRASTER: "Quit bickering. We have no idea what's going on or why we're here. But we need to work together to get back."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Voice of reason. Draster cuts through emotion with logic — his character function in the trio.

### Panel 5 — Medium

**Action:** Spyke and June, both scowling in opposite directions. Neither happy, but both silent. Draster spots something in the distance — a trail of smoke rising above the treeline.
**Dialogue:**
- SPYKE: "I'm not working with this fool."
- JUNE: "I'm not working with this moody motherf—"
- DRASTER: "STOP."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** June gets cut off mid-profanity by Draster. The reader fills in the blank. Comedy and tension in the same beat.

---

## Page 29

### Panel 1 — Medium

**Action:** Draster points toward the smoke in the distance.
**Dialogue:**
- DRASTER: "Over there. Smoke. Let's go."
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Practical leadership. Draster ends the argument by giving them a direction. The trio isn't friends yet, but they have a common goal.

### Panel 2 — Wide

**Action:** Draster takes the lead, walking toward the smoke trail. After a beat, Spyke and June follow — separately, keeping distance from each other. They walk through the alien landscape of blue grass and blue-leafed trees under the pink sky. Earth hangs massive in the sky behind them.
**Dialogue:** —
**SFX:** —
**Notes:** Final composition shot. Three people who don't like each other, walking together because they have no other choice. The alien landscape dwarfs them. This is the beginning of their real journey.

> **[PLAYER DECISION POINT]** — *Player gains full control. Exploration tutorial: switch party leader. Random encounters on the path to Jairek's shack.*

## End Hook

**What pulls the reader to the next chapter:** The trio is stranded on an alien planet with no allies, no information, and tension already splitting the group. The smoke leads them toward the first friendly face — Jairek — who will tell them the crushing truth: there's no way to leave Terra. Meanwhile, Hood (Morkain) orchestrated everything. Why did he send them here? What does he want with Spyke? And back on Earth, a monstrous Fang is about to attack London...
