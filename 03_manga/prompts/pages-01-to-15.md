## PAGE PROMPTS

### Page 1 — London 3031 / Spyke's Morning Sprint

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

3-panel vertical layout. Top panel is a wide cinematic establishing shot taking up roughly half the page. Two medium panels stacked below.

PANEL 1 (WIDE — top half of page): Breathtaking establishing shot of London in the year 3031. A vertical megacity of massive tower structures rising from an endless ocean. The towers are connected by bridges, walkways, and elevated platforms at various heights. Hover vehicles glide between buildings through misty air corridors. The sky is a gorgeous pink-orange dawn gradient. Far below at the waterline, the tops of ancient landmarks are barely visible — the clock face of Big Ben and the tip of the Shard poke just above the ocean surface, dwarfed by the futuristic towers. Cinematic wide-angle, slightly elevated camera looking across the skyline. Atmospheric perspective with haze between distant towers.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — bottom left): Close-medium shot of Big Ben's clock face, partially submerged — ocean water laps at the 6 o'clock mark. The clock reads 9:00. The bell is chiming. An elevated walkway runs past at clock-face level with tiny pedestrians visible. Stylized SFX text integrated into the panel in large bold letters: "BONG BONG BONG" radiating outward from the bell tower.

PANEL 3 (MEDIUM-WIDE — bottom right): A young man — Spyke (shoulder-length ginger hair, red bandana tied in his hair with tails trailing, green eyes, black combat clothing) — sprints along a crowded elevated walkway in the Westminster district. A massive broadsword strapped to his back swings wildly as he runs, forcing startled commuters to duck and dodge out of the way. His red bandana streams behind him. Speed lines emphasize his velocity. A thought bubble near his head reads: "Shit. I'm gonna be late..." Energetic, dynamic running pose, slight low-angle camera.
```

### Page 2 — The Shortcut

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

4-panel layout. Two panels on top row, two panels on bottom row.

PANEL 1 (CLOSE-UP — top left): Tight profile close-up of Spyke's face mid-sprint. Wind blasts his ginger hair and red bandana backward. His green eyes are sharp and determined, locked forward. A bead of sweat on his brow. Speed lines streaking past. High energy, intense expression.

PANEL 2 (WIDE — top right): Spyke spots a narrow gap between two massive tower buildings — a tight alleyway shortcut. He cuts hard to the left off the main elevated walkway, leaping over a railing. The alley is a vertical slash of shadow between gleaming sci-fi architecture. A thought bubble reads: "The shortcut... 23 seconds." Dynamic angle showing the width of the main walkway versus the narrow alley entrance.

PANEL 3 (MEDIUM — bottom left): Spyke emerges from the narrow alley onto a small grassy pocket park on an elevated platform. Green grass, a bench, a small tree — a rare natural space among the towers. Three street punks sit on the bench smoking — all wearing black streetwear, short swords visible at their hips. The leader is the biggest, in a leather jacket with a scar. They look up as Spyke appears. Warm filtered light on the park, contrasting the shadowed alley behind Spyke.

PANEL 4 (MEDIUM — bottom right): The three punks stare at Spyke, sizing him up. The biggest punk in the center leans forward on the bench with an aggressive grin, cigarette dangling. The other two flank him, smirking. Spyke walks past them, eyes locked forward, not breaking stride, broadsword prominent on his back. Tension in the framing — punks in foreground watching, Spyke mid-ground walking away.
```

### Page 3 — Confrontation

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

4-panel vertical stack layout, slight panel tilts for tension.

PANEL 1 (MEDIUM — top): Shot from behind Spyke as he walks away. His massive broadsword on his back dominates the center of the frame — huge, imposing, catching the light. Beyond him in the background, the lead punk stands up from the bench, calling out. Dialogue balloon from the punk: "Hey... that's a pretty cool weapon on yo' back." The other two punks watch from the bench. Spyke does not turn around.

PANEL 2 (CLOSE-UP — upper middle): Extreme close-up of Spyke's eyes from the side angle. Cold, dismissive, not even acknowledging the voice. He keeps walking. An off-panel dialogue balloon trails in from behind: "Is that just for show, or do you know how to use it?" No reaction from Spyke. Flat, icy expression.

PANEL 3 (MEDIUM — lower middle): The lead punk has closed the distance and grabs Spyke's shoulder from behind. Spyke's hand instantly snaps down to the katana at his left hip — a reflexive, lethal-fast movement. His expression shifts from cold to dangerous. Dialogue — PUNK: "I'm talking to you!" SPYKE: "Don't touch me." Behind the lead punk, the other two punks flank out, giggling. Tense composition, the moment before violence. Speed lines on Spyke's hand reaching the katana.

PANEL 4 (MEDIUM — bottom): Spyke has swiveled to face the three punks head-on. His right hand rests on the katana hilt — not drawn yet, but ready. The three punks fan out into fighting positions, the two smaller ones drawing their short swords. The biggest punk hangs back, arms crossed, letting his boys go first. Dialogue — PUNK: "I asked you a qu—" SPYKE (cutting him off, sharp dialogue balloon): "I don't have time for this. Get lost!" Confrontational framing, Spyke alone against three.
```

### Page 4 — Quick Work

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

3-panel layout with strong diagonal panel borders for action energy.

PANEL 1 (MEDIUM-WIDE — top, largest panel): Two smaller punks rush Spyke from different angles simultaneously. The big punk stays back, arms crossed, watching. Spyke draws his katana in a fluid, lightning-fast motion, blocking the first punk's overhead slash. Steel meets steel. Dialogue — PUNK 2: "Come on, let's play..." Stylized SFX text: "CLANG" at the point of impact with radiating impact lines. Speed lines on Spyke's draw. Dynamic diagonal composition emphasizing the chaos of the attack.

PANEL 2 (CLOSE-UP — middle): Tight action shot. Spyke pushes the first punk away with a shove of his katana blade, simultaneously pivoting his body to block the second punk's attack coming from behind. Sparks fly from the blade contact. Stylized SFX text: "SHING" on the push, "CLANG" on the block. Heavy speed lines tracing Spyke's rotation arc. His red bandana whips with the motion. Intense, tight framing focused on the katana work.

PANEL 3 (MEDIUM — bottom): The aftermath. Spyke stands in a relaxed combat stance, katana held one-handed at his side, blade angled down. The two smaller punks are on the ground groaning, swords knocked away. The big punk watches from the background, unfazed, arms still crossed. A thought bubble from Spyke: "Hmph... guess I could do with a warm up." Slight smirk on Spyke's face. Calm after the storm — composed framing contrasting the action above.
```

### Page 5 — Broadsword vs. Broadsword

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

4-panel layout. Top two panels side by side, bottom two panels — one massive action panel and a smaller exit panel.

PANEL 1 (MEDIUM — top left): The big punk steps forward from the background, finally drawing his own weapon — a large broadsword matching Spyke's in scale. He grins with cocky confidence, hefting the blade over one shoulder. Dialogue — PUNK 1: "I asked if you could use that big sword on your back!" The two defeated punks groan behind him on the ground. The punk's broadsword catches the light.

PANEL 2 (CLOSE-UP — top right): Close-up of Spyke's face. A flicker of genuine interest crosses his expression — one eyebrow raised slightly. His hand reaches back over his shoulder, gripping the hilt of his massive broadsword. The corner of his mouth twitches upward. Dialogue — SPYKE: "Hmph!" Green eyes sharpened with anticipation. The broadsword hilt is prominent in frame.

PANEL 3 (WIDE — bottom, large action panel spanning most of the width): Explosive full-page-width action shot. Spyke swings his massive broadsword in a devastating horizontal arc. The big punk blocks with his own broadsword but is sent skidding backward across the grass, boots tearing furrows in the ground. Cracks spider-web through the platform beneath the punk's feet from the sheer force. A faint blue-white Plasma energy crackle runs along Spyke's blade edge — ethereal, luminous. Stylized SFX text in huge letters: "KRAAAANG" across the panel. Maximum speed lines, impact shockwave rings, dynamic low-angle camera. Screen tone shading on the impact zone.

PANEL 4 (MEDIUM — bottom right, smaller): Spyke calmly sheathes his broadsword onto his back. The big punk lies on the ground behind him, defeated, sword broken. Spyke walks away without looking back. A thought bubble: "I'm gonna miss the train..." Calm, cool framing. Red bandana fluttering gently. Complete contrast to the explosive panel beside it.
```

### Page 6 — The Watcher

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

5-panel layout. Top wide panel, three medium panels in a middle row, one medium panel at bottom.

PANEL 1 (WIDE — top): Wide shot from behind as Spyke walks away across the elevated pocket park. In the background, the three defeated punks lie sprawled on the grass. Tower city skyline visible beyond the park edges. Spyke's silhouette with the broadsword on his back is the focal point. Calm, quiet moment — warm dawn light.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — middle left): The three knocked-out punks suddenly vanish — their bodies dissolve into puffs of dark, oily black smoke that curls upward and dissipates. The grass where they lay is empty. Stylized SFX text: "POOF POOF POOF" in wispy, smoke-like lettering. Eerie and unsettling.

PANEL 3 (MEDIUM — middle center): From the shadows of a nearby alley, a tall hooded figure steps into partial view. Hood — entirely shrouded in a full-length black cloak, face hidden in deep shadow beneath the hood, a broadsword held casually in one hand. Dark purple-black aura wisps curl off the cloak like living shadows. The figure stares in the direction Spyke walked. Menacing, heavy atmosphere. Dark tones contrasting the bright park.

PANEL 4 (CLOSE-UP — middle right): Spyke mid-stride, suddenly freezing. A cold visual effect — icy blue tendrils or chill-lines — crawls up his back and neck. He glances over his shoulder, eyes narrowed. A thought bubble: "...What was that?" His expression is unsettled — rare vulnerability. Screen tone shading intensifies around him for atmosphere.

PANEL 5 (MEDIUM — bottom): Spyke's POV shot — looking back at the park. It is completely empty. No punks, no hooded figure, no sign anyone was ever there. Just wind rustling the grass and leaves. Peaceful but wrong. The emptiness itself is ominous. Quiet panel, no dialogue, no SFX — just the empty park and swaying grass.

### Page 7 — The 9:27 from Kings Cross

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

3-panel vertical layout. Top establishing shot, middle interior, bottom destination reveal.

PANEL 1 (WIDE — top, cinematic): A sleek futuristic train streaks through a transparent tube-tunnel suspended between massive tower structures high above the ocean. The hover-rail system — the tube is glass or energy-shielded, and passengers are visible through the train windows as tiny silhouettes. The vast ocean stretches far below, towers rising around the rail line. Narration box in upper corner: "The 9:27 from Kings Cross. The only train to the Formican Army base." Stylized SFX text: "WHOOOOSH" trailing behind the train in elongated motion letters. Dramatic perspective — slightly low angle showing the scale of the towers and the train cutting between them. Speed lines along the tube trajectory.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — middle): Interior of the train carriage. Spyke sits alone in a row of seats. His massive broadsword is propped against the seat next to him — no one dares sit near it, creating an empty buffer zone. Spyke has his arms crossed, staring out the window with a distant, unreadable expression. Scattered around the carriage are other young candidates — teenagers and young adults carrying various weapons (visible swords, staffs, holstered guns). Some look nervous, some look confident. Warm interior lighting, sleek train design with holographic displays.

PANEL 3 (WIDE — bottom): View through the train windows as the destination comes into sight. The Formican Army base — an enormous military complex sprawling across multiple tower platforms. At its center rises a massive pyramid structure, gleaming in the morning light. Airships dock at high platforms. Streams of soldiers and young candidates flow toward the complex from rail platforms and walkways. Impressive, imposing, militaristic scale. The pyramid dominates the composition.

### Page 8 — Registration

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

3-panel layout. Wide establishing panel on top, two medium panels on bottom row.

PANEL 1 (WIDE — top): Spyke walks through the grand entrance of the Formican Army base. The interior is sleek and militaristic — polished metal corridors, holographic signage floating in the air with directions and candidate numbers. Stewards in crisp Formican blue uniforms direct the flowing crowds of candidates. Through massive glass walls, the pyramid structure is visible outside. The scale is impressive — high ceilings, wide corridors, hundreds of people. Narration box: "The Formican Army. Drafted to fight the monsters that appear where Plasma concentrates." Spyke is small in the frame, walking among the crowd, broadsword marking him out.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — bottom left): Spyke stands at a registration desk. A bored-looking registrar sits behind a holographic screen interface, tapping data. The registrar is middle-aged, bureaucratic, unimpressed. Dialogue — REGISTRAR: "You'll be paired with two others. Your pass or fail depends on teamwork." SPYKE (arms crossed, dismissive): "I don't need to be paired with anyone. I can do this myself." Spyke's body language radiates resistance — stiff posture, chin up, not looking at the registrar.

PANEL 3 (MEDIUM — bottom right): The registrar is completely unmoved by Spyke's attitude. Flat expression, still tapping the holographic screen. Dialogue — REGISTRAR: "Teamwork is paramount to field work. You're free to explore until test time." Spyke visible turning away in the background, irritated. The registrar does not even look up. Dry, bureaucratic energy versus Spyke's intensity.
```

### Page 9 — Meet the Team

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

5-panel layout. Three panels in the top two-thirds, two smaller panels on the bottom third.

PANEL 1 (MEDIUM — top left): Spyke in a wide waiting area within the base. He is warming up alone — practicing controlled katana swings in precise arcs. His movement is fluid and focused, entirely in his own world. Other candidates give him a wide berth in the background. Speed lines trace his blade's arc. Focused, solitary energy.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — top right): June approaches Spyke. She is a young woman — blonde hair being tied back into a ponytail as she walks, sporty blue top, short shorts over black tights, a single shoulder pad armor piece, shortsword at hip, pistol holster on right thigh, and a magician glove on her left hand. Bright, approachable energy. Dialogue — JUNE: "Are you in for this slot?" SPYKE (not stopping his practice, barely glancing): "Yes." Contrast between June's open body language and Spyke's closed-off focus.

PANEL 3 (CLOSE-UP — middle, spanning width): Split-focus close-up. June extends her hand with a bright, genuine smile, introducing herself. Spyke gives her a single sideways glance then looks away, continuing his warm-up without taking her hand. Dialogue — JUNE: "Great! My name is June. I look forward to—" SPYKE (cutting her off bluntly): "Spyke." His tone is flat, dismissive. June's extended hand hangs in the air. The contrast in their expressions is key — her warmth meeting his wall.

PANEL 4 (CLOSE-UP — bottom left): Close-up of June's face. Her bright smile has been replaced by barely contained irritation and forced composure. Eyes slightly narrowed, jaw tight, smile turned stiff. A thought bubble: "He must have been that guy yelling earlier... Great. How did I get stuck with him?" Comedic frustration energy with a manga-style annoyance vein mark near her temple.

PANEL 5 (SMALL INSET — bottom right): Small panel. June glances at Spyke from behind. Her eyes travel to the massive broadsword on his back — the sheer size of it. Her eyes widen slightly with reluctant impression. A thought bubble: "...He does look strong though." Subtle shift from annoyance to grudging respect. The broadsword fills the background of this small panel.
```

### Page 10 — The Trio Forms

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

4-panel layout. Two panels on top, two panels on bottom.

PANEL 1 (MEDIUM — top left): A young man walks toward Spyke and June from across the waiting area. Draster — dark brown skin, black and silver hair neatly kept, soft brown eyes, wearing a navy jacket-style suit-robe (elegant, military-inspired cut extending to mid-calf), both hands casually in pockets, leather Plasma Gloves visible on his hands. Calm, composed, unhurried walk. Dialogue — DRASTER: "Yo, you guys here for the exam?" His demeanor is friendly but measured.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — top right): Draster reaches them, giving a polite nod. June's expression brightens immediately — relieved to have someone sociable. Dialogue — DRASTER: "My name is Draster. Pleased to meet you." JUNE (animated, gesturing between them): "Hey Draster! I'm June and this is Spyke! Pleased to meet you!" June is warm and welcoming, pointing toward Spyke who stands apart from the conversation. Draster is composed and pleasant.

PANEL 3 (CLOSE-UP — bottom left): Close-up of Spyke's face. He gives Draster a flat, cold glare. Completely silent. A small dialogue bubble with just: "..." No warmth, no engagement. Green eyes flat and disinterested. Classic manga cold-shoulder reaction shot.

PANEL 4 (MEDIUM — bottom right): First group shot of all three standing together. Spyke stands slightly apart from the other two, arms crossed, broadsword on his back. June has her arms crossed too, looking disappointed by Spyke's attitude, glancing at him sideways. Draster stands calmly between them, hands in pockets, unbothered. Dialogue — SPYKE: "Let's just get this over with." The three are together but not yet a team — body language showing disconnection. The base interior stretches behind them.
```

### Page 11 — The Greenhouse Dome

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

4-panel layout. Large establishing panel on top, three panels across the bottom.

PANEL 1 (WIDE — top, largest panel, half the page): Stunning establishing shot. The trio steps through a doorway and the scene transforms completely — they enter a massive greenhouse dome. The interior is lush tropical jungle — towering exotic trees, dense green foliage, hanging vines, colorful flowers. The dome ceiling far above is painted or projected to look like a sunset sky in warm oranges and pinks. The contrast is jarring and beautiful — from the sterile metal corridors of the military base to this vibrant living space. The three small figures stand at the entrance, dwarfed by the enormous dome interior. Light filters through the canopy in golden shafts.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — bottom left): The trio's reactions in a medium group shot. June's eyes are wide with wonder, mouth slightly open, taking in the beauty. Draster observes the environment analytically — eyes scanning, studying the terrain and layout with tactical awareness. Spyke immediately scans for threats — eyes sharp, body tense, hand near his weapon. Dialogue — JUNE: "Whoa..." Each character's personality shown through their reaction to the same stimulus.

PANEL 3 (MEDIUM — bottom center): The trio looks upward as an intercom crackles from speakers in the dome ceiling. Dialogue — INTERCOM (from a speaker icon or broadcast-style balloon): "Your mission: defeat the Ravage and obtain the gold ring it carries." JUNE (looking around, arms out): "And where is this Ravage?!" DRASTER (calm, slight smile): "That would be too easy..." The intercom text has a mechanical, broadcast quality to the balloon style.

PANEL 4 (MEDIUM — bottom right): Silent panel — no dialogue, no SFX. Spyke has already spotted a trail path leading into the jungle and started walking down it without waiting or announcing himself. June and Draster are visible behind him exchanging a look — a shared glance of "here we go" — before following. Spyke's back and broadsword lead the composition deeper into the jungle path. Natural, unforced character dynamic.
```

### Page 12 — The Ravage

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

3-panel vertical layout. Top exploration panel, middle reveal panel (largest), bottom reaction panel.

PANEL 1 (WIDE — top): The trio moves through the dome jungle in formation. Dense tropical vegetation surrounds them — strange alien-looking plants mixed with recognizable jungle flora. Sunset-colored light filters through the dome canopy above. Spyke takes point at the front, katana hand ready. June walks in the middle, alert. Draster brings up the rear, observing everything. Subtle SFX text in small letters: "CHIRP CHIRP" from unseen creatures, and soft "rustle rustle" from the undergrowth. Atmospheric and tense — something is ahead.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — center, largest panel): The jungle path opens into a wide clearing. In the center of the clearing stands the Ravage — a massive beast. It is a behemoth quadrupedal creature with thick armored hide like natural plate armor. Muscular, powerful, the size of a large bull or bigger. A gold ring is pierced through its nose, glinting in the light. The beast senses the trio arriving and turns its massive head toward them, growling with bared teeth. Its eyes are feral and hostile. Stylized SFX text: "GRRRRR" emanating from the beast in jagged, threatening letters. The clearing frames the beast dramatically — it is the dominant presence.

PANEL 3 (CLOSE-UP — bottom): Close-up of Spyke's face. A slight grin spreads across his features — not warm, but excited, predatory. His hand reaches back to grip his broadsword hilt. Green eyes locked on the Ravage with intensity. Dialogue — SPYKE: "So you're the Ravage, huh?" Confident, eager. The Ravage's silhouette looms in the background behind him, blurred.
```

---

### Page 13 — Teamwork Problems

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

4-panel layout. Two panels on top, wide action panel in middle, one panel at bottom.

PANEL 1 (MEDIUM — top left): Spyke draws his massive broadsword and steps forward aggressively, leaving June and Draster behind. Solo hero stance — wide legs, sword raised, facing the Ravage alone. His body language screams "stay out of my way." Dialogue — SPYKE: "You two stay back. I'll handle this." June and Draster visible behind him, cut off.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — top right): June steps forward furiously, drawing her shortsword with a sharp motion. Her expression is fired up — angry, determined, refusing to be sidelined. Behind her, Draster quietly pulls his leather Plasma Gloves tighter, preparing for combat with calm focus. Dialogue — JUNE: "Are you kidding?! We need to work together!" Her dialogue balloon is sharp-edged, showing her intensity. Manga-style anger marks near her head.

PANEL 3 (WIDE — middle, largest panel): Full-width action panel. Spyke charges the Ravage head-on in a reckless solo assault. He swings his broadsword in a massive slash aimed at the beast's chest — but the blade bounces off the Ravage's thick armored hide with zero damage. The Ravage barely flinches, rearing up on its hind legs. Spyke is thrown off balance by the rebound. Stylized SFX text: "CLANG" at the point of impact, "THUD" as the force reverberates. Speed lines on Spyke's charge. Impact rings showing the deflection. The Ravage towers over Spyke, emphasizing its power.

PANEL 4 (MEDIUM — bottom): June rolls her eyes hard (comedic exasperation), then locks eyes with Draster. Both immediately sprint to flank the Ravage from different sides. Dialogue — JUNE: "Grrr! Draster, let's go!" DRASTER: "Hmph... I guess we all need to be alive to pass." Draster's tone is dry and pragmatic. Both in motion — June fast and agile, Draster measured and tactical. The Ravage looms between them and Spyke in the middle ground.
```

### Page 14 — Three-Way Assault

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

4-panel layout. All panels are dynamic action shots with heavy speed lines and impact effects. Tilted panel borders for maximum energy.

PANEL 1 (WIDE — top, large action panel): Three-way coordinated assault on the Ravage, shown in a dynamic bird's-eye or angled composition. Spyke attacks from the front, drawing the beast's attention and aggro — broadsword swinging to keep the Ravage focused on him. June circles to the beast's side at high speed — her Plasma shoes glow blue-white as she uses burst-dashes for agility, shortsword ready. Draster hangs back at range — his leather Plasma Gloves glow with elemental energy as he casts a concentrated wind blast aimed at the Ravage's tail. Stylized SFX text: "WHOOSH" trailing June's speed, "CRACK" from Draster's wind spell. Action lines radiating from all three combatants. The Ravage is caught in the crossfire.

PANEL 2 (CLOSE-UP — middle left): Close-up impact shot. Draster's wind blast strikes the Ravage's tail directly. The beast staggers, its powerful legs buckling from the targeted hit. The armored plates on its body visibly separate and shift, revealing gaps in the natural armor. Off-panel dialogue balloon from June: "The tail! That's its weak point!" Stylized SFX text: "CRACK" with impact ripples. Screen tone shading on the stressed armor plates. Detail on the Ravage's body showing the vulnerability.

PANEL 3 (WIDE — middle right to bottom left, large action panel): Spyke sees the opening and seizes it. He rushes in with a massive overhead two-handed swing of his broadsword, bringing it down on the staggered Ravage with full force. The impact sends a visible shockwave through the ground — cracks radiate outward from the strike point, dust and debris fly. Blue-white Plasma energy crackles intensely along Spyke's blade edge, the glow at its brightest. Stylized SFX text in the largest letters on the page: "KRAKOOOM" exploding across the panel. Maximum impact — speed lines, shockwave rings, flying debris, Plasma energy discharge. Camera angle from low, looking up at Spyke mid-swing with the Ravage beneath.

PANEL 4 (MEDIUM — bottom right): The aftermath. The Ravage collapses and its body begins dissolving into glowing Plasma dust particles — sparkling motes of light floating upward and dissipating into the air. Beautiful and ethereal. The gold ring falls from the dissolving snout and lands on the grass with a tiny clink. The dome jungle is suddenly quiet — peaceful. Stylized SFX text in small, delicate letters: "clink" next to the ring. Contrast between the explosive action above and this serene dissolving moment. The trio visible in the background, catching their breath.
```

### Page 15 — No Exit

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout.

4-panel layout. Two panels on top, two panels on bottom. Tension builds across the page.

PANEL 1 (MEDIUM — top left): Spyke bends down and picks up the gold ring from the grass, holding it up and examining it between his fingers. June and Draster stand behind him, catching their breath — June has hands on knees, Draster stands with hands at his sides, composure returning. Dialogue — SPYKE: "This is it, huh?" JUNE (straightening up, eager to leave): "OK, we've got it — now let us out!" The gold ring catches the filtered dome light. Relief in the body language.

PANEL 2 (MEDIUM — top right): Several seconds pass. Silence. No intercom response, no doors opening. The trio exchanges uneasy looks — Spyke narrows his eyes, June looks around confused, Draster furrows his brow. Dialogue — DRASTER: "I guess we find the exit ourselves. Let's go back the way we came." The silence is palpable — no SFX, no ambient sound text. The dome feels suddenly too quiet.

PANEL 3 (WIDE — bottom left): The trio retraces their steps back through the dome jungle. But something is subtly wrong — the lighting has shifted, casting longer and darker shadows through the vegetation. The warm sunset tones have cooled to deeper oranges and purples. The path looks slightly different — plants seem to have shifted, familiar landmarks are off. An uneasy atmosphere pervades the panel. The trio walks in formation but with visible tension in their postures. No dialogue — the visual tells the story.

PANEL 4 (MEDIUM — bottom right): They arrive at where the entrance door should be — but the door is gone. In its place is a solid wall of dense vegetation growing against the dome's inner structure. Seamless, impassable. Spyke puts his hand flat against the wall, pressing, confirming it is real and solid. June and Draster stand behind him. Dialogue — SPYKE: "Hmm? The door was here." DRASTER: "I thought so too. Did we take a wrong turn?" SPYKE (firm, certain): "No. It was here." Tension and mystery — the page ends on this unsettling note. The wall of vegetation fills the right side of the panel, blocking any exit.

## Usage Notes

- **Copy-paste each code block directly** into Nano Banana (Google Gemini image model) as a single prompt.
- Each prompt is fully self-contained — no need to reference other pages or external sheets.
- If output lacks detail, prepend: "highly detailed, professional manga art, anime studio quality, full color" to the prompt.
- If panel layouts are not respected, try adding: "manga page layout with clearly separated panels and white gutters between them" to the beginning.
- For **consistent character designs**, generate character reference sheets first (see `character-sheets.md`) and use them as style references if the model supports image-to-image or style transfer.
- **SFX text** should be rendered as stylized, integrated lettering — not plain text overlays. If SFX are not appearing correctly, add: "hand-drawn sound effect text in bold stylized manga lettering integrated into the artwork."
- **Dialogue balloons** may need to be added in post-production if the model does not render text legibly. Focus on getting the visual compositions correct.
