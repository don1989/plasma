Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Four-panel page, arranged in a 1x4 vertical stack with slight staggering for visual interest. Interior of a futuristic biodome environment — lush vegetation, artificial sky, enclosed structure visible in background. Year 3031 sci-fi setting.

Panel 1 (MEDIUM SHOT): A young woman with blonde hair tied back, wearing a sporty top, short shorts, black tights, and shoulder pad armor, stands with her arms thrown out wide in frustration. She looks around the dome interior, agitated and annoyed. Her expression is exasperated, brow furrowed, mouth open mid-complaint. A pistol holster on her hip and a shortsword at her side. A magician-style glove on her left hand. Speech balloon: "Great... are we lost now?!"

Panel 2 (MEDIUM SHOT): A sudden supernatural gust of wind sweeps violently through the dome. Three characters are hit by the gust — the blonde woman from panel 1; a young man with shoulder-length ginger hair, a red bandana, green eyes, a huge broadsword strapped to his back and a katana at his hip; and a dark brown-skinned man with black and silver hair, soft brown eyes, wearing a navy suit-robe jacket with glowing Plasma Gloves on both hands. Their hair and clothes whip violently in the wind. The dark-skinned man shields his eyes with one arm. The ginger-haired young man's hand instinctively reaches for his katana. Speed lines radiate from the center of the panel. Speech balloon from the dark-skinned man: "Wind? In here?" Large stylized SFX text integrated into the panel: "WHOOOOSH"

Panel 3 (MEDIUM SHOT): Close on the ginger-haired young man with the red bandana. His expression hardens, eyes narrowing with sharp focus. He shifts into a battle-ready stance, hand gripping the katana hilt, weight low. Intense, serious, commanding presence. Speech balloon: "Something is up. Stay alert. Don't get killed."

Panel 4 (WIDE SHOT): The wind intensifies dramatically. Through swirling leaves, dust, and debris, a tall figure materializes from the wind itself — a cinematic entrance. The figure wears a full black hooded cloak, face completely hidden in shadow with only the lower jaw barely visible. He holds a broadsword casually in one hand. A dark purple-black aura radiates from him. Flanking him on either side are three punk-styled humanoid copies with blank, wrong-looking eyes — empty, puppet-like, unsettling. The trio of heroes stands in the foreground, backs to camera, facing this ominous arrival. The composition frames Hood as the center of a storm, emerging like a specter.

Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Four-panel page — two smaller panels on top, one wide action panel in the middle, one action panel on the bottom. Interior of a futuristic biodome. Tension escalating into combat.

Panel 1 (CLOSE-UP): Extreme close on the face of a young man with shoulder-length ginger hair, a red bandana, and the collar of a white sleeveless cloak visible at his neck. His green eyes widen — first with recognition, then shifting to anger. Jaw tightens. The emotion reads clearly: he has seen this figure before. Speech balloon: "It was you earlier."

Panel 2 (MEDIUM SHOT): The ginger-haired young man in a white knee-length sleeveless cloak points his drawn katana directly at a tall figure in a full black hooded cloak whose face is hidden in shadow. The young man's stance is aggressive, demanding — his red fingerless left glove and armoured right glove both grip the hilt. His red bandana flutters, white cloak billows. Speech balloon: "Who are you?!"

Panel 3 (WIDE SHOT — ACTION): Before the hooded figure can respond, three punk-styled humanoid copies with blank, wrong eyes rush toward the trio of heroes. The punks' movements are inhuman — jerky, puppet-like, limbs bending at slightly wrong angles. Speed lines fill the panel. The three heroes — the ginger-haired swordsman, a blonde woman with a pistol and shoulder pad armor, and a dark brown-skinned man with glowing Plasma Gloves — are forced into immediate combat. Dynamic poses as they react to the sudden attack.

Panel 4 (MEDIUM SHOT — ACTION): Simultaneous triple-action composition. Left: the blonde woman fires her pistol at one punk, muzzle flash bright. Center: the dark-skinned man in the navy suit-robe jacket blasts another punk with a burst of fire magic erupting from his Plasma Gloves, flames spiraling outward. Right: the ginger-haired swordsman slashes through the third punk with his katana in a clean arc. All three punks dissolve into wisps of dark smoke upon being struck. Stylized SFX text integrated across the panel: "BANG" near the pistol, "FWOOSH" near the fire blast, "SLASH" near the katana strike.

Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Four panels arranged in a standard grid — two rows of two panels each. Interior of a futuristic biodome. Post-combat tension, confrontation with the hooded figure.

Panel 1 (MEDIUM SHOT): The blonde woman with tied-back hair and shoulder pad armor is breathing hard, pistol still raised but lowered slightly. Beside her, the dark brown-skinned man in the navy suit-robe jacket stands alert, his Plasma Gloves still faintly glowing. Both stare at the spots where the punks dissolved into dark smoke — wisps still fading in the air. Speech balloon from the blonde woman: "What's going on?!" Speech balloon from the ginger-haired young man (off-panel or at panel edge): "That guy attacked me earlier."

Panel 2 (MEDIUM SHOT): The ginger-haired young man with the red bandana faces the tall hooded figure directly. His knuckles are white on the katana grip, rage visibly building in his expression — jaw clenched, eyes blazing. The hooded figure stands perfectly still in the background, black cloak undisturbed, broadsword held loosely in one hand. Speech balloon: "What the hell are you?!"

Panel 3 (MEDIUM SHOT): The hooded figure speaks. He is perfectly still — unnaturally so. His full black cloak drapes without movement. Only the lower jaw is barely visible beneath the hood's shadow. A dark purple-black aura wisps around him. His speech balloon has a darker, rougher border with a different lettering style to convey an eerie, resonating voice that fills the dome. Speech balloon (stylized): "You will know soon enough."

Panel 4 (MEDIUM SHOT): The hooded figure tilts his head slightly to one side. His posture carries something almost like amusement — subtle, unsettling. The dark aura around him pulses faintly. Speech balloon (stylized dark border): "You've passed the test. Now it's time to go."

## Page 19

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Four panels — three standard panels stacked, then a large explosive action panel at the bottom taking up roughly half the page. Interior of a futuristic biodome. Escalating confrontation ending in a rage-fueled charge.

Panel 1 (MEDIUM SHOT): The blonde woman with tied-back hair and shoulder pad armor steps forward aggressively, fists clenched at her sides, leaning toward the hooded figure. Defiant and demanding. Behind her, the dark brown-skinned man in the navy suit-robe jacket stands with a more cautious, analytical expression. Speech balloon from the blonde woman: "Is this part of the test?!" Speech balloon from the dark-skinned man: "I don't think so."

Panel 2 (MEDIUM SHOT): Close on the ginger-haired young man's face. His teeth are gritted hard, veins visible at his temple. His green eyes burn with barely contained rage. Sweat beads on his forehead. The red bandana frames his furious expression. Speech balloon: "Answer me! What are you and what do you want?!"

Panel 3 (CLOSE-UP): The hooded figure's lower face — the only visible part beneath the deep shadow of the black hood. A thin, almost dismissive expression. Speech balloon (stylized dark border): "Hmph..."

Panel 4 (WIDE SHOT — ACTION): The ginger-haired young man snaps. He charges the hooded figure with explosive force, having drawn the massive Plasma broadsword from his back. He roars as he swings — the attack is wild, powerful, and completely uncontrolled, driven by pure rage. Speed lines streak across the panel. The PANEL BORDERS themselves become JAGGED and AGGRESSIVE — broken, sharp-edged, cracked — visually reflecting the character's fury. His red bandana streams behind him. The blonde woman and dark-skinned man react with alarm in the background. Speech balloon (large, jagged lettering): "RRAAAGH!!"

Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Four panels — wide action panel on top, a narrow close-up strip, another action panel, and a close-up at the bottom. Interior of a futuristic biodome. The clash between the ginger-haired swordsman and the hooded figure.

Panel 1 (WIDE SHOT — ACTION): The ginger-haired young man with the red bandana brings his massive Plasma broadsword down on the hooded figure with devastating, earth-shattering force. The hooded figure blocks with ONE HAND on his own broadsword — effortlessly, without shifting his stance even a fraction. The impact creates a visible shockwave that cracks the ground beneath them in a spiderweb pattern. Dust and debris explode outward. The hooded figure doesn't move an inch. The contrast between the attacker's full-body exertion and the defender's casual one-handed block tells the whole story. Large stylized SFX text: "KRAAANG"

Panel 2 (EXTREME CLOSE-UP): Just the ginger-haired young man's eyes — his green irises FLASH RED for a single instant. Adrenaline Mode activating involuntarily. The art style in this panel shifts noticeably — heavier inks, sharper lines, higher contrast. The panel border is jagged and cracked, reflecting the internal power surge.

Panel 3 (MEDIUM SHOT — ACTION): The ginger-haired swordsman attacks again, this time faster — rage-enhanced speed from the Adrenaline Mode flicker. His movements are sharper, more explosive. He catches the hooded figure slightly off guard. The broadsword slices past the hooded figure's defense and a visible scratch-tear appears on the black cloak — the first damage anyone has dealt. Speed lines emphasize the increased velocity. Stylized SFX text: "SLASH"

Panel 4 (CLOSE-UP): The hooded figure looks down at the scratch on his cloak. Then his hidden face tilts back toward the ginger-haired swordsman. The darkness under the hood seems to deepen — thicker, more opaque. The body language reads as silent assessment: interested, but not threatened. A dark purple-black aura pulses subtly around the tear in the cloak. No dialogue — the silence speaks volumes.

## Page 21

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Three panels — one massive action panel across the top half, two panels splitting the bottom half. Interior of a futuristic biodome. The hooded figure demonstrates overwhelming power.

Panel 1 (WIDE SHOT — ACTION): The tall hooded figure in the full black cloak raises his empty hand — the one not holding his broadsword. A MASSIVE blast of wind erupts from his open palm, depicted as concentric force waves and swirling air currents. All three heroes are hit simultaneously. The blonde woman and the dark brown-skinned man are blown backward like ragdolls, bodies ragdolling through the air, expressions of shock and pain. The ginger-haired swordsman digs his broadsword into the ground as an anchor, leaning into the wind at a steep angle, but still sliding backward, boots carving furrows in the ground. Debris, leaves, and dust fill the air. The force is overwhelming. Large stylized SFX text: "WHOOOOOM"

Panel 2 (MEDIUM SHOT): All three heroes are on their knees, battered and wounded. The ginger-haired swordsman has his massive broadsword planted blade-down in the ground, using it as a crutch to stay partially upright. His red bandana is torn, ginger hair disheveled. The blonde woman clutches her ribs, face twisted in pain. The dark-skinned man's Plasma Gloves spark and flicker, their power fading. All three are breathing hard, bruised, and outclassed. Speech balloon from the ginger-haired swordsman: "Goddamnit... what are you..."

Panel 3 (MEDIUM SHOT): The hooded figure stands over the fallen trio, shot from a low angle to emphasize his dominance. He is completely untouched — pristine except for the single scratch on his cloak from earlier. Broadsword resting in one hand. His posture radiates calm authority as he speaks down to them. The dark purple-black aura wisps around him. Speech balloon (stylized dark border): "Just call me... Hood."

## Page 22

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. PAGE-TURN REVEAL page. Four panels — building tension and dread across all four. The hooded figure initiates a teleportation vortex. Interior of a futuristic biodome. Dramatic escalation.

Panel 1 (MEDIUM SHOT): The trio struggles on the ground. The ginger-haired young man with the red bandana tries to stand, using his massive broadsword jammed into the ground as a lever to pull himself up. His arms tremble with effort. The blonde woman shows defiance through her pain — teeth bared, eyes fierce even while hurt. The dark brown-skinned man tries to speak but winces, one hand pressed to his side. Speech balloon from the dark-skinned man: "Hey... what the hell..."

Panel 2 (CLOSE-UP): The hooded figure raises one hand. Wind begins to swirl around the trio in a deliberate pattern — not a random attack, but a forming VORTEX. Leaves, dust, and points of light spiral upward in a tightening funnel. The energy is different from before — structured, purposeful, magical. Speech balloon (stylized dark border): "Now it's time to go to Terra..." Stylized SFX text building in intensity: "WHOOOOSH"

Panel 3 (CLOSE-UP): The blonde woman's face fills the panel. Pure shock. Her eyes are wide open, pupils contracted. Her mouth hangs open. The wind whips her tied-back blonde hair loose. This is genuine fear and disbelief. Speech balloon (large, shaky lettering): "WHAT?!"

Panel 4 (MEDIUM SHOT): The ginger-haired swordsman drags himself to his feet in one last desperate surge. He lifts his massive broadsword with everything he has left, attempting a final charge toward the hooded figure. But the wind vortex is already pulling at him — his feet barely grip the ground, his body leans against the pull. His red bandana whips violently, nearly tearing free. His face is pure rage and desperation. Speech balloon (large, aggressive lettering): "GODDAMNIT!!!"

## Page 23

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. FULL PAGE SPLASH — single image filling the entire page. This is the climactic moment: the trio leaves Earth. No panel borders — the image bleeds to all edges.

A massive tornado of wind, dust, energy, and light engulfs all three heroes completely. The ginger-haired young man's roar is silenced as all three are lifted off the ground, consumed by the swirling vortex. Their silhouettes are visible within the storm — the ginger-haired swordsman reaching out with one hand, the massive broadsword still gripped in the other; the blonde woman curled defensively; the dark-skinned man's gloves sparking uselessly.

At the calm center of the storm stands the hooded figure — perfectly still, black cloak barely moving, broadsword held loosely at his side. Patient. In complete control. The dark purple-black aura merges with the vortex energy.

Around them, the biodome itself SHATTERS. The artificial sunset sky, the lush jungle trees, the dome structure — all fragmenting like broken glass, pieces floating outward and dissolving. Reality fracturing. Through the cracks, impossible light pours in.

The composition places the hooded figure as the still axis around which everything spins and breaks. The color palette shifts from the warm dome environment to cold, otherworldly light at the edges.

NO DIALOGUE. NO SPEECH BALLOONS. NO SFX TEXT. Let the image carry everything. This is the moment they leave Earth.

## Page 24

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Four panels — a stark transition page. The setting shifts entirely to the alien planet Terra. Mood shifts from chaos to eerie quiet.

Panel 1 (BLACK PANEL): Total darkness. The entire panel is solid black — no image, no environment, nothing visible. Only a single small, subtle heartbeat sound effect in thin, delicate lettering placed in the center. SFX (small, quiet): "ba-dump"

Panel 2 (EXTREME CLOSE-UP): A hand lying limp on strands of vivid BLUE grass. The grass is a striking, saturated blue — clearly alien, not Earth vegetation. The fingers twitch slightly, showing the first sign of life. The detail on the grass blades and the hand should be precise — individual blades of blue grass curling around the fingers.

Panel 3 (CLOSE-UP): The ginger-haired young man's face, cheek pressed against the blue grass. His eyes flutter open — groggy, confused, vulnerable. His vision is blurred, depicted with soft focus or slight double-vision effect around the panel edges. His red bandana is askew. This is a rare moment of vulnerability — this character is almost never seen this way. Sweat and dirt on his face. No dialogue.

Panel 4 (MEDIUM SHOT): The ginger-haired swordsman pushes himself up to a crouching position on the blue grass. His massive broadsword lies on the ground a few feet away from him. In the background, slightly out of focus, the blonde woman and the dark brown-skinned man are beginning to stir — the woman on her side, the man face-down. The blue grass stretches around all of them. The sky above is a soft PINK — alien and beautiful. No dialogue.

## Page 25-26

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. FULL DOUBLE-PAGE SPREAD — a single breathtaking panoramic image spanning two full pages. No panel borders. This is THE KEY VISUAL of the entire chapter. The image must be awe-inspiring and beautiful.

The young man (age 21) with spiky ginger hair (tips reaching his traps) and a red bandana stands in the center-left of the composition, having just risen to his feet on alien terrain. He wears a white knee-length cloak with sleeves cut — the dojo emblem clearly visible on the back of the cloak, a decorative pattern running along the bottom hem. A red fingerless glove on his left hand with a red bracer on the left wrist, an armoured steel-grey full-fingered glove on his right hand, a red-accented belt, and a metal knee pauldron on his right knee. He is seen from behind or three-quarter view, looking out at the vista before him — his white cloak catching the alien wind, the patterned hem fluttering. His massive broadsword hangs at his side or rests on his back. His posture conveys stunned stillness.

The landscape of TERRA stretches out before him in full panoramic glory:
- Vivid BLUE grass carpets the rolling terrain to the horizon, swaying gently like an ocean of sapphire.
- The sky is a soft, warm PINK with cotton-candy clouds drifting lazily — whites and pale pinks and lavenders.
- BLUE-LEAFED TREES dot the landscape — their trunks are natural brown and gray, but every leaf is a rich blue, creating groves that look like clusters of blue coral or sapphire canopies.
- The air has a thick, hazy quality — heat-shimmer distortion that makes distant objects waver slightly, giving the atmosphere a dreamlike density.

In the sky, dominating the upper portion of the spread, PLANET EARTH hangs like an enormous moon. It is massive — far larger than the Moon appears from Earth. The oceans are vivid blue, continents recognizable in green and brown, white cloud swirls wrapping the sphere. It is unmistakably Earth, hanging impossibly in an alien pink sky.

Behind the ginger-haired swordsman: the blonde woman sits up on the blue grass, staring upward at Earth in the sky, mouth slightly open. The dark brown-skinned man rises to his feet nearby, one hand shielding his eyes from the pink-tinted light as he takes in the view.

The composition is vast and open — emphasizing the scale of this alien world and the smallness of the three figures within it. Light pours warmly across the scene.

Speech balloon from the ginger-haired swordsman (small, quiet, awed): "...That's Earth."

## Page 27

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Four panels. Setting: the alien planet Terra — blue grass, pink sky, blue-leafed trees, Earth visible in the sky. The emotional aftermath of arrival.

Panel 1 (MEDIUM SHOT): The blonde woman with tied-back hair (now partially loose and messy) kneels on the vivid blue grass, staring upward at the massive Earth hanging in the pink sky. Her face shifts from initial wonder to creeping dread — the beauty of the view giving way to the horror of the situation. Her sporty top and shorts are dirty and torn from the earlier fight. Speech balloon: "Shiiiit..."

Panel 2 (MEDIUM SHOT — LONG/WIDE): A pulled-back long shot showing three small figures in the vast alien landscape. They are tiny against the sweeping terrain of blue grass, blue-leafed trees in the middle distance, and the enormous pink sky with Earth overhead. The composition emphasizes their isolation — three people alone on an alien world. Silence. No dialogue.

Panel 3 (MEDIUM SHOT): The ginger-haired swordsman picks up his massive broadsword from the blue grass and sheathes it on his back with a practiced motion. His face is set and hard — he has already moved past the shock. His green eyes are focused, practical. He is the first to shift into action mode. Speech balloon: "We need to get back."

Panel 4 (MEDIUM SHOT): The blonde woman snaps. She rounds on the ginger-haired swordsman, rising to her feet, finger pointing accusingly at him. Her expression is fierce — anger born from fear. He stands with his back partially turned, not fully engaging. Speech balloon from the blonde woman: "Who the hell was that guy, Spyke?!" Speech balloon from the swordsman: "I don't know." Speech balloon from the blonde woman (continuing, overlapping): "Why was he following you?! Did you not think to investigate before—"

## Page 28

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Five panels — a heated argument page. Setting: alien planet Terra — blue grass underfoot, pink sky, blue-leafed trees nearby, Earth in the sky. Conflict between teammates.

Panel 1 (MEDIUM SHOT): The ginger-haired swordsman with the red bandana turns sharply on the blonde woman. They are face to face, neither backing down — almost nose to nose. Both bristling with aggression. His green eyes blaze. Her blue eyes match his intensity. The body language is confrontational — leaning into each other's space. Speech balloon from the swordsman: "What?! You blaming this on me?!" Speech balloon from the blonde woman: "He was after YOU! Now we're on another planet because of you!"

Panel 2 (MEDIUM SHOT): The argument intensifies. Both are shouting simultaneously, mouths wide open, gesturing aggressively. In the background, the dark brown-skinned man in the navy suit-robe jacket watches with his arms crossed, his expression showing patience wearing thin — jaw tight, brow lowered. Speech balloons CROWD the panel — overlapping, competing for space, visually representing the chaos of the argument. Speech balloon from the swordsman: "I couldn't even sense the guy until the exam!" Speech balloon from the blonde woman: "Yeah, but you must have known—"

Panel 3 (WIDE SHOT): The dark brown-skinned man steps physically between the two arguers, both arms extended outward to separate them. His face is stern and commanding — this is the FIRST TIME he has been seen anything other than calm and composed. His soft brown eyes are hard. His Plasma Gloves glow faintly with authority. Speech balloon (large, bold lettering): "ENOUGH."

Panel 4 (MEDIUM SHOT): The dark-skinned man faces both of them, standing between them. His posture is firm but measured — a mediator who has had enough. He speaks with authority and logic. Speech balloon: "Quit bickering. We have no idea what's going on or why we're here. But we need to work together to get back."

Panel 5 (MEDIUM SHOT): The ginger-haired swordsman and the blonde woman face in opposite directions — backs partially to each other, arms crossed, both scowling. Stubborn silence from both. In the background, the dark-skinned man has turned away from both of them and noticed something: a thin trail of smoke rising in the distance above the treeline of blue-leafed trees. Speech balloon from the swordsman: "I'm not working with this fool." Speech balloon from the blonde woman: "I'm not working with this moody motherf—" Speech balloon from the dark-skinned man (cutting off, firm): "STOP."

## Page 29

```
Colored manga page, cel-shaded, clean linework, vibrant colors, dynamic panel layout. Two panels — a simple, powerful closing page. Setting: alien planet Terra — blue grass, pink sky, blue-leafed trees, Earth in the sky. The beginning of the journey.

Panel 1 (MEDIUM SHOT): The dark brown-skinned man with black and silver hair, wearing the navy suit-robe jacket and Plasma Gloves, points decisively toward a thin column of smoke rising in the distance above the treeline of blue-leafed trees. His expression is practical and determined — moving forward regardless of the group's dysfunction. Speech balloon: "Over there. Smoke. Let's go."

Panel 2 (WIDE SHOT — FINAL COMPOSITION): A beautiful, cinematic composition. The dark-skinned man takes the lead, walking purposefully toward the distant smoke trail through a field of vivid blue grass. After a visible beat of hesitation — a gap of space between them — the ginger-haired swordsman with the red bandana and white knee-length cloak follows on one side, and the blonde woman follows on the other, both keeping deliberate distance from each other. None of them walk side by side. Three separate people moving in the same direction because they have no other choice.

The alien landscape stretches around them — rolling blue grass, groves of blue-leafed trees with natural brown trunks, the pink sky with cotton-candy clouds overhead. Behind them, dominating the sky, EARTH hangs massive and beautiful — oceans, continents, and clouds clearly visible, a constant reminder of how far from home they are.

The composition frames them small against the vast alien world. The mood is quiet, tense, uncertain — but forward-moving. This is not a team. Not yet. But this is the beginning of their real journey. No dialogue. Let the image close the chapter.
