## STYLE GUIDE

### Art Style
- **Colored manga** — full color, manga art style, cel-shaded with clean linework
- NOT black and white; vibrant, saturated colors throughout
- Anime/manga proportions and facial features (large expressive eyes, stylized hair)

### Line Weight
- **Medium-thick outlines** for character silhouettes and major forms
- **Thinner lines** for interior details (clothing folds, hair strands, facial features)
- Clean, confident linework — no sketchy or rough edges

### Character Color Palettes
- **Spyke Tinwall:** Reds (bandana, left glove, bracer), white (cloak), blacks (combat clothing), steel grey (armor/weapon metal, right armoured glove), ginger hair, green eyes
- **June:** Blues (sporty top), whites (accents), gold/blonde hair, warm skin tones
- **Draster:** Navy (suit-robe), silver (hair highlights, glove accents), dark tones overall, dark brown skin
- **Hood (Morkain):** Pure black (cloak), dark purple aura/energy wisps, no visible skin color

### Weapon Rendering
- All **Plasma weapons** emit a faint **blue/white energy glow** along their cutting edges
- The glow is soft and ethereal, not overpowering — like a thin luminous outline hugging the blade
- Spyke's broadsword glows the most intensely; other weapons have subtler glows

### Panel Style (for the full manga)
- **Dynamic layouts:** tilted panels, overlapping frames, broken borders during action
- **Speed lines** for motion and combat sequences
- **Screen tone textures** for shading and atmospheric depth (even in color, use tone-style gradients)
- **Sound effects** rendered as stylized text integrated directly into panels (Japanese onomatopoeia style)

## CHARACTER SHEET PROMPTS

---

### 1. Spyke Tinwall (Protagonist)

```
Colored manga character reference sheet, clean linework, cel-shaded, vibrant colors, white background, multiple views (front, 3/4, side, back), expression sheet below.

Character: Spyke Tinwall, male, age 21, slim but strong athletic build, lean muscle definition visible on arms and shoulders.

Hair: Spiky ginger/copper-red hair — slightly longer than shoulder-length, with the tips reaching down to his trapezius muscles, but not super long. The hair is spiky and textured with natural volume and layering. A bright red bandana is tied into the hair (the bandana belonged to his Master — it is worn wrapped around the top of his head with the tails trailing into his hair).

Eyes: Piercing green eyes, sharp and intense gaze. Note on sheet: left eye transforms — turns purple with a black sclera when his inner demon activates, and turns solid glowing red in Adrenaline Mode.

Clothing: A white knee-length cloak with the sleeves cut off (similar to his deceased Master's cloak — flowing, slightly battle-worn, open at the front). The cloak has a dojo emblem/crest on the back (his Master's dojo insignia) and a decorative pattern running along the bottom hem. Underneath: dark black fitted shirt, black combat pants with reinforced knees, a metal knee pauldron on his right knee (the pauldron conceals hidden daggers — but in this reference sheet DO NOT show the daggers; the pauldron should look like a solid armour piece). Dark boots. A red-accented belt around his waist. Red fingerless glove on his LEFT hand with a red bracer/wrist guard on the left wrist. An armoured full-fingered glove on his RIGHT hand — the right glove is steel grey, plated, covering all fingers. Overall color scheme is white (cloak), reds (bandana, left glove, bracer, belt accent), blacks (combat clothing), and steel grey (right armoured glove, knee pauldron, weapon metal).

Weapons: (1) A massive Plasma broadsword strapped to his back over the cloak — the sword is absurdly oversized, nearly as tall as he is, with a wide heavy blade that emits a faint blue-white Plasma energy glow along its edges. The hilt is wrapped in dark leather. (2) A katana sheathed at his left hip — the blade has a distinctive pattern etched into the steel (a patterned/damascus-style blade). Dark scabbard. (3) Hidden daggers concealed inside the metal knee pauldron (NOT shown on this sheet — they are a secret reveal for later).

Views: Front full-body view, 3/4 angle view, side profile view, back view showing the broadsword strapped across his back and the dojo emblem on the cloak.

Expression sheet (6 expressions, bust/head shots arranged in a row below the full-body views):
1. Neutral/cold — blank stare, emotionless, guarded
2. Angry/snarling — teeth bared, eyebrows furrowed, veins visible
3. Battle-focused — narrowed eyes, tight jaw, intense concentration
4. Rare smirk — one corner of mouth lifted, slightly cocky, reluctant amusement
5. Shocked — wide eyes, mouth slightly open, caught off guard
6. Inner pain — left eye bleeding (a thin trail of blood running from his left eye down his cheek), pained grimace, clenching teeth

Include detail callouts for: the red bandana closeup, the white cloak back view showing the dojo emblem and bottom hem pattern, the red fingerless left glove and red bracer vs the armoured right glove comparison, the metal knee pauldron (closed, no daggers visible), the patterned katana blade closeup, the red belt accent, the Plasma broadsword blade glow effect, and the demon eye transformation (green → purple/black → red).

Weapons and Gear: (1) A shortsword in a sheath at her left hip — compact and practical, suited for fast close-range combat. (2) One magician glove on her left hand — a fingerless glove with arcane/magical markings or subtle glowing runes etched into the fabric. (3) A pistol holster strapped to her right thigh containing a compact handgun. (4) Plasma-imbued shoes — her boots/sneakers have a faint blue-white Plasma energy glow emanating from the soles and edges, indicating they are magically enhanced for speed or agility.

Eyes: Soft warm brown eyes, gentle and perceptive, giving him a calm and thoughtful appearance.

Clothing: An all-in-one suit-robe hybrid — imagine a navy blue naval-style jacket that extends into a long robe-like lower half reaching to about mid-calf. The jacket portion is structured and buttoned with a high collar, military-inspired cut with clean lines. The lower portion flows more loosely like a robe or long coat. The overall silhouette is elegant and distinguished. Dark navy is the dominant color with subtle silver trim or piping along the edges and seams. Dark pants and dark boots visible beneath the suit-robe.

Weapons and Gear: Leather Plasma Gloves on both hands — fitted leather gloves that cover the full hand and wrist, dark brown or black leather with subtle elemental pattern engravings etched into the surface (small motifs suggesting fire, water, wind, earth — arcane elemental symbols).

3. Firm/commanding — brows slightly lowered, jaw set, authoritative and serious without being angry
4. Slight smile — gentle, warm, understated smile with soft eyes
5. Combat-casting — intense focus, gloves glowing with bright elemental energy (blue-white Plasma light emanating from both hands), eyes sharp
6. Surprised — eyebrows raised high, eyes widened, mouth slightly parted, a rare break from composure

Include detail callouts for: the Plasma Gloves showing the elemental pattern engravings up close (both glowing and inactive states), the suit-robe's naval jacket collar and button details, and the silver highlights in his hair.

### 4. Hood (Morkain in Disguise)

```
Colored manga character reference sheet, clean linework, cel-shaded, vibrant colors (dark palette), white background, multiple views (front, 3/4, side, back), pose sheet below.

Character: Hood (true identity: Morkain, kept hidden). Tall imposing figure, entirely shrouded in a full-length black hooded cloak. The cloak is heavy, flowing, and all-concealing — it covers the entire body from head to toe. The hood is deep and pulled far forward, casting the face in complete shadow. Only the lower jaw and mouth are barely visible beneath the hood's shadow — pale skin, thin lips, no other facial features shown. The figure radiates menace and stillness, an overwhelming sense of contained power.

Cloak Details: Pure black fabric, heavy and slightly tattered at the bottom hem. The cloak has a dark purple inner lining barely visible when it shifts. A dark aura and wind-like energy constantly emanates from the figure — wisps of dark purple-black energy curling off the cloak edges like smoke or shadow tendrils. The overall silhouette is tall, broad-shouldered, and ominous.

Weapon: A broadsword held in one hand — a large, dark-bladed sword gripped casually in the right hand, held at the figure's side. The sword is plain and brutal in design, dark metal, heavy and functional.

Build: Tall (significantly taller than the teenage protagonists), broad-shouldered, powerful frame implied beneath the cloak but no body details visible.

Views: Front full-body view, 3/4 angle view, side profile view, back view showing the cloak's drape and trailing dark energy.

Pose sheet (4 poses, full-body, arranged in a row below the main views — NO facial expressions since face is hidden):
1. Standing neutral — perfectly still, broadsword held loosely at side, dark energy wisping off the cloak, weight evenly distributed, an unsettling calm
2. Combat stance — broadsword raised and held forward in one hand, cloak billowing, dark aura intensifying around the figure, aggressive and threatening
3. Raising hand (wind power) — left hand extended forward with palm open, a visible vortex or blast of dark wind energy spiraling outward from the hand, cloak whipping in the generated wind
4. Walking away — viewed from behind at a slight angle, walking slowly into darkness or shadow, broadsword resting on shoulder, cloak trailing, dark energy dissipating behind like a wake

Include detail callouts for: the shadowed face showing only the lower jaw/mouth, the dark purple-black aura energy effect, the broadsword design, and the tattered cloak hem with inner purple lining visible.

### 5. Punks (x3 — Group Sheet)

```
Colored manga character reference sheet, clean linework, cel-shaded, vibrant colors, white background. Group character sheet for three street punk thugs shown together.

Characters: Three young male street thugs/punks, generic antagonist designs, cocky and aggressive body language. They are a small gang. All dressed in black streetwear/punk fashion.

Punk Leader (center, tallest): The biggest and tallest of the three, broad-shouldered, muscular build, intimidating. Wears a black leather jacket (open, no shirt underneath or a dark tank top), black ripped jeans, heavy boots, chain accessories (wallet chain, chain necklace). Aggressive sneer on his face. A short sword sheathed at his hip. Cocky wide stance, arms crossed or one hand on the hilt of his sword. Spiky or slicked-back dark hair, a scar on his face (cheek or brow).

Punk 2 (left, medium build): Average height, lean and wiry. Wears a black hoodie with the sleeves torn off, dark cargo pants, combat boots, fingerless gloves. A beanie or bandana on his head. Sneering or smirking expression. Short sword at his hip. Slouched posture, hands in pockets or cracking knuckles.

Punk 3 (right, smallest): The shortest and scrappiest of the three. Wears a black t-shirt with a torn collar, black skinny jeans, sneakers, studded wristbands. Messy unkempt hair. Twitchy and eager expression, like he is looking for a fight. Short sword at his hip. Bouncing on his feet or pointing aggressively.

Group arrangement: All three standing together in a line — Leader in center (tallest, dominant), Punk 2 on the left leaning casually, Punk 3 on the right with restless energy. They should look like a cohesive gang with matching black streetwear aesthetic but individual personality.

Views: One group shot (front view, all three together), then individual front-facing full-body views of each punk side by side for design clarity.

Include detail callouts for: the short sword design (same basic weapon for all three — simple, cheap-looking blade), the Leader's chain accessories, and each punk's distinguishing accessory (Leader: scar + leather jacket, Punk 2: torn hoodie + beanie, Punk 3: studded wristbands + torn collar shirt).

## Usage Notes

- **Copy-paste each code block directly** into Nano Banana (Google Gemini image model) as a single prompt.
- If the output is not detailed enough, re-run the prompt and add "highly detailed, professional character design, anime studio quality" to the beginning.
- For **turnaround sheets** with more angles, add: "include 3/4 rear view" to the views list.
- To get the **demon eye variants** for Spyke, you may need to run a separate focused prompt just for the eye transformation sequence.
- For **weapon detail sheets**, extract the weapon descriptions and run them as standalone prompts with "weapon design sheet, multiple angles, white background, colored manga style" as the prefix.
