  Spyke (age 21) — cold neutral expression (NEVER smiling, flat face),
  ginger hair (STRAIGHT and layered, length between traps and shoulders,

  sharp green eyes, black fitted t-shirt under white knee-length cloak
  (sleeves crudely cut off at shoulder — raw frayed edges NOT clean

  along bottom hem), red-accented belt,
  ARMS (as seen by viewer, character facing forward):
  arm on LEFT of image: red fingerless glove on hand only, bare forearm;

  forearm ONLY, stops exactly at elbow, upper arm completely bare;
  ONLY the arm on the RIGHT of the image has the bracer,
  LEGS: black combat pants,
  knee on RIGHT of image: large hexagonal metal knee pauldron;
  knee on LEFT of image: completely bare — NO pad, NO pauldron at all,
  BACK: massive plasma broadsword in enormous sheath (sheath is half
  body height, wide enough for a broadsword — NOT a thin katana sheath);
  blade is wide + thick, tapers symmetrically toward middle; dark grey;
  HARNESS: thick brown leather X-harness — main strap runs over RIGHT
  shoulder, diagonally down across chest to LEFT waist, then back across
  body and up to RIGHT shoulder forming a clear X; secondary support strap

  center of sheath at front — both straps worn ON TOP of cloak, visible in

reference_sheet_prompt: |
  Colored manga character reference sheet, Spyke Tinwall. Clean linework,
  cel-shaded, vibrant colors, high-resolution, white background.
  Four full-body views: Front, 3/4 Angle, Side Profile, Back.
  EXPRESSION: cold, flat, neutral — NEVER smiling, NOT friendly.
  CHARACTER: male, age 21, slim but strong athletic build, lean muscle.
  HAIR: Ginger/copper-red, STRAIGHT and layered, length between traps and
  shoulders — does NOT touch shoulders, NOT spiky, NOT messy, NOT long.
  BANDANA: bright red bandana worn ONLY as a forehead strip — like a
  headband sitting at the hairline. It does NOT wrap around the skull,
  does NOT cover the top or back of the head. Only the forehead-width
  strip is visible, with short tails tucking into the hair at the sides.
  EYES: sharp green.
  TORSO: black fitted t-shirt under a white knee-length cloak. The cloak
  originally had sleeves — they were CRUDELY CUT OFF at the shoulder,
  leaving raw frayed edges at the shoulder holes. Arms are completely
  bare. Cloak has a black geometric pattern along the bottom hem and a
  distinct black dojo insignia on the center of the back.
  BELT: red-accented belt at waist.
  ARMS (ASYMMETRICAL — must be correct in ALL four views):
  - Character's RIGHT arm (LEFT side of image in front view): red
    fingerless glove on the hand only, stops at the wrist. Forearm and
    upper arm completely bare.
  - Character's LEFT arm (RIGHT side of image in front view): red
    metallic armored bracer/gauntlet that covers the hand and forearm
    ONLY — it ends exactly at the ELBOW JOINT and goes no further.
    The upper arm from elbow to shoulder is bare skin. The bracer does
    NOT extend above the elbow under any circumstances.
  - Only ONE arm has the bracer. The back view must also show only one
    arm with the bracer.
  LEGS: black combat pants. Dark combat boots.
  - Character's LEFT knee (RIGHT side of image): LARGE hexagonal metal
    knee pauldron — hexagonal shape, covers the entire knee cap, bigger
    than the knee itself so it clearly stands out.
  - Character's RIGHT knee (LEFT side of image): completely bare. No
    pad, no pauldron at all.
  BROADSWORD (back-mounted — CRITICAL — must show in ALL four views):
  - MASSIVE weapon — blade alone is roughly HALF his full body height.
    The blade is WIDE (broadsword width, NOT a thin katana blade). Wide,
    thick, heavy. Width clearly visible. Maintain this EXACT blade design
    consistently across all views — same width, same symmetrical taper,
    same dark grey/metallic color.
  - Design: hilt flows into blade, tapers symmetrically narrower toward
    the middle then back out. Dark grey/metallic.
  - Carried in an ENORMOUS sheath on his back. The sheath is BIG —
    large enough to contain the full broadsword, visibly wide and long.
  - ANGLE: the sheath sits diagonally — hilt sticks up over his RIGHT
    shoulder so he can reach back with his right hand to draw it. The
    sheathed blade runs diagonally across his back, tip pointing toward
    his lower LEFT side.
  - HARNESS (thick brown leather — CRITICAL — visible in ALL four views):
    * MAIN STRAP: starts at the RIGHT shoulder, crosses diagonally down
      across the front of his body to his LEFT waist, then continues back
      across the body and up to the RIGHT shoulder — forming a clear
      diagonal X shape across his chest (viewed from front) and back.
    * SECONDARY SUPPORT STRAP: runs from the center of the sheath at the
      BACK, around his body to the RIGHT side of his waist, then connects
      to the center of the sheath at the FRONT — stabilising the bottom
      of the sheath horizontally.
    * Both straps are thick, brown leather, worn ON TOP of the white cloak.
    * Clearly visible in FRONT, 3/4, SIDE, and BACK views.
  - BACK VIEW: the broadsword sheath DOMINATES the back view — enormous,
    wide, running diagonally from upper-right to lower-left. The thick
    brown leather harness straps are clearly visible crossing his back.
  KATANA (character's LEFT hip — RIGHT side of image in front view):
  - Patterned katana in a sheath, attached horizontally to his belt on
    his LEFT hip (RIGHT side of image in front view — NOT the left side
    of the image).
  - Visible in all four views.
  CONSISTENCY — these elements must match EXACTLY across all four views:
  - Cloak dojo insignia: same shape, same position on center of the back
    panel — reproduce it identically in 3/4 and back views.
  - Bottom hem geometric pattern: same pattern, same scale, same style
    across all views.
  - Broadsword blade: same wide, symmetrically-tapering dark grey blade
    in every view — do not narrow or change the shape between views.
  - Brown leather harness: same routing, same thickness in all four views.
  VIEW REQUIREMENTS — each view must look genuinely different:
  - FRONT VIEW: facing directly toward viewer, full symmetrical front.
  - 3/4 ANGLE VIEW: body turned approximately 45 degrees, showing depth
    and perspective. The face turns slightly. The sword hilt and back
    sheath begin to be visible. Clear spatial depth, NOT a flat front view.
  - SIDE PROFILE VIEW: exactly 90 degrees sideways — pure silhouette
    from the side. The broadsword sheath protrudes prominently behind
    him. Completely different from the front — only one arm visible,
    side of face only, full depth of sheath visible.
  - BACK VIEW: facing directly away from viewer. The ENORMOUS broadsword
    sheath DOMINATES this view — wide, long, running diagonally from
    upper-right to lower-left on his back. The thick brown leather
    harness straps are clearly visible crossing his back in an X. The
    secondary support strap runs horizontally around to his right waist.
    The dojo insignia is clearly visible on the center back of the cloak.
    This must look completely different from the front.
