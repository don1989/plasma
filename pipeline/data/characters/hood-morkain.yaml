  Character: Hood (true identity: Morkain, kept hidden). Tall imposing
  figure, entirely shrouded in a full-length black hooded cloak. The cloak
  is heavy, flowing, and all-concealing. The hood is deep and pulled far
  forward, casting the face in complete shadow. Only the lower jaw and
  mouth are barely visible beneath the hood's shadow.
  Cloak Details: Pure black fabric, heavy and slightly tattered at the
  bottom hem. The cloak has a dark purple inner lining barely visible when
  it shifts. A dark aura and wind-like energy constantly emanates from the
  figure — wisps of dark purple-black energy curling off the cloak edges
  like smoke or shadow tendrils.
  Weapon: A broadsword held in one hand — a large, dark-bladed sword
  gripped casually in the right hand. The sword is plain and brutal in
  design, dark metal, heavy and functional.
  Build: Tall (significantly taller than the teenage protagonists),
  broad-shouldered, powerful frame implied beneath the cloak.
