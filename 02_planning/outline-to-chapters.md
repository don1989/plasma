# Outline to Chapters — Plasma

> **Purpose:** Convert a high-level story outline into structured chapter beats. Use this skill after the story bible is established and you have a rough arc/outline ready.

---

## Instructions

Given an outline or arc summary, produce the following:

### 1. Act Structure

Break the story into acts (3-act, 4-act, or custom). For each act, state:
- **Act name/number**
- **Purpose** (what this act accomplishes narratively)
- **Emotional arc** (where the audience starts and ends emotionally)

### 2. Chapter List

Number each chapter sequentially. For each chapter, provide:

```
## Chapter [N]: [Title]

- **Goal:** What must this chapter accomplish for the story?
- **Conflict:** What obstacle or tension drives the chapter?
- **Key scenes:** 2-4 bullet points of what happens
- **Twist / Reveal:** What new information or shift occurs?
- **Cliffhanger / Hook:** What pulls the reader into the next chapter?
- **Characters present:** Who appears in this chapter?
- **Location(s):** Where does this chapter take place?
- **Canon references:** Any bible entries this chapter depends on
```

### 3. Pacing Notes

After the chapter list, add:
- Which chapters are high-intensity vs. breathing room
- Where major reveals land relative to page count
- Any chapters that could be combined or split

---

## Rules

- Every chapter must advance at least one of: plot, character development, or world-building.
- No chapter should exist solely for exposition. Weave info into action or conflict.
- Check all events against `lore-consistency-rules.md` before finalizing.
- Flag any chapter that requires a canon update.
