## Premise & Theme

**Premise:**
In the year 3031, Earth has been flooded and civilization lives atop towering structures above the water. Plasma, an energy source from the alien planet Terra, powers everything. But Terra's arrival in the solar system brought monsters, war, and a ticking clock — a catastrophic ball of Plasma is heading toward Terra, and when it hits, Terra will consume Earth's lifeforce just as it consumed its previous paired planet, Gaia. Spyke Tinwall, a young man raised in captivity by his abusive father, discovers he carries the blood of an ancient civilization. Alongside June and Draster, he must collect 12 zodiac gems from Terra's shrines, build an alliance against the tyrannical Formican Army, and find a way to prevent the catastrophe — all while a demon entity inside him fights for control.

**Core Themes:**
- **Found family vs. blood family** — Spyke's abusive father vs. the bonds he forms with June, Draster, and allies across Terra
- **Power and corruption** — Morkain's descent from idealism to tyranny; the seductive nature of the ancients' power
- **Trauma and recovery** — Spyke's emotional walls from childhood abuse; learning to trust
- **Colonialism and prejudice** — Humans (via Formican Army) are oppressors on Terra; the trio must overcome species-wide distrust
- **Destiny vs. choice** — Are the ancients guiding Spyke, or is he forging his own path?
- **The cost of war** — Every victory has collateral damage (Juniper Village burned, Delton destroyed)

## Setting Summary

### Earth (3031)
The planet is flooded. Humanity lives in tower cities above the water. Hover vehicles, AI buses, and mobile phones are standard. The Formican Army is a powerful military organization that controls much of society, recruiting young people through entrance exams. Monsters (Fangs, etc.) attack cities periodically — most people don't know these are manufactured.

### Terra
An alien planet that entered Earth's solar system. **Blue grass, pink sky, blue-leafed trees, heavy air** (harder to breathe for newcomers). Terra is rich in Plasma energy. Once governed by Supreme Governor Jairek and the Imperials, it is now under the complete control of Morkain and the Formican Army, divided into 5 Dukedoms.

Terra was once part of a larger planet called **Tetra**, which was split by Plasma into **Terra** and **Gaia**. Gaia was the home of the ancients. When Terra paired with Gaia, it eventually consumed Gaia's lifeforce, destroying it. Now Terra is paired with Earth, and the cycle threatens to repeat.

A **barrier** envelops Terra that turns anything touching it to dust — no one can leave by conventional means.

### The Catastrophe
A massive ball of Plasma energy is heading toward Terra. When it hits, it will devastate Terra and cause Terra to consume Earth's lifeforce, potentially destroying both civilizations. The ancients of Gaia tried to stop it with magic and failed. The cycle has repeated before (Gaia, and before that, a planet called Titan). No known solution exists yet.

## World Rules (Hard Limits)

See `lore-consistency-rules.md` for the complete ruleset. Key rules:

1. Plasma weapons are impossibly heavy without Plasma manipulation ability
2. Monsters can only be killed with Plasma
3. Blood of the ancients grants powers at a painful cost (eye bleeding, headaches, demon possession risk)
4. Time-freeze is an ancient power — only Morkain and Spyke can use/perceive it
5. Death is permanent — no resurrection
6. Terra's barrier prevents anyone from leaving the planet
7. The catastrophe cannot be easily stopped — the ancients themselves failed
8. 12 shrines exist with zodiac gems; only those with ancient blood can hear the shrine voices

## Factions & Goals

| Faction | Goal | Methods | Status |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| **Formican Army** | Control both Terra and Earth; Morkain seeks to become one with Terra and prevent the catastrophe on his terms | Military occupation, monster manufacturing, crystal research, underground tunnels to Terra's core | Controls all 5 Dukedoms, navy, airships, and ports |
| **Spyke's Alliance** | Stop Morkain, prevent the catastrophe, free Terra | Shrine exploration, guerrilla operations, diplomacy with species of Terra | Growing — Dwarves, Gunners Green, Juniper survivors, individual allies |
| **Dwarves of Knadville** | Reclaim their homeland | Mining, fog magic, military resistance | Allied with Spyke after retaking city |
| **Gnomes of Delton** | Survive; protect the artefact | Technology, ancient knowledge | Nearly extinct; Dobblepot is one of the last |
| **Juniper Village** | Rebuild; resist Formicans | Bounty hunting, community defense | Burned down; survivors rebuilding |
| **Gunners Green Orphans** | Survive in the Old District | Gun manufacturing, underground living | Allied with Spyke (Cannon's handshake) |

## Open Mysteries & Planned Reveals

| Mystery | What We Know | Reveal Potential |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| What happened to Seymour? | Last seen with crystal fused in chest at Goldhawk. Disappeared. | Could appear as enemy, ally, or transformed being. Crystal connection to Morkain's operations. |
| What happened to Memphis and the orphans? | Memphis was chief instructor. Orphanage fate after Master's death is unknown. | Potential ally recruitment. Could be prisoners of Formican Army. |
| Master's real name | Never revealed. Called "The Saviour" by some. | May connect to a larger history — his father Ruben was Formican Army. |
| Marik's backstory | Lost left eye and left arm. Arrived at Juniper 4-5 years ago. Aggressive. | Connection to Formicans? Previous shrine visitor? Lost battle with Morkain? |
| What is the gnome artefact? | Locked beneath Delton. Summons "Guardians of Terra." King's spell needed to open. | Could be the key to matching Morkain's power. Guardians could fight the catastrophe. |
| How to activate the zodiac gems | 4 collected (Sagittarius, Cancer, Leo, Gemini). No activation method known. | All 12 may be needed. Could grant power comparable to Morkain's. |
| Tinwall's true motives | Imprisoned Spyke, serves Morkain, but asked Morkain to bring Spyke to him. | May have been protecting Spyke in a twisted way? May need Spyke's blood for something. |
| The demon inside Spyke | Connected to blood of the ancients. Gets stronger near crystals/shrines. Attempted possession. | May be an ancient entity. May be necessary to control to unlock full power. May consume Spyke if unchecked. |
| What is Morkain's actual plan? | Wants to reach Terra's core. Claims to be saving Earth. Uses underground tunnels. | "Becoming one with Terra" — may involve merging with the planet's Plasma core. |
| How to stop the catastrophe | Ancients tried magic and failed. Morkain claims he has a plan. | May require all 12 gems, the gnome artefact, AND Morkain's knowledge. May not be "stoppable" — only survivable. |
| Why does Morkain want Spyke alive? | Spyke has blood of the ancients. Morkain threatened but never killed him. | May need Spyke's blood/power for his plan to reach Terra's core. |
| Bazzleton/Bazzleworth spelling | Both appear in the source document. | **Author decision needed.** |
