# Lore Consistency Rules — Plasma

> **Purpose:** Hard constraints the model must obey at all times. These prevent power creep, deus ex machina, and world-breaking contradictions. No draft or script may violate these rules without an explicit canon update.

---

## How to Use

When writing or reviewing any Plasma content, check every scene against these rules. If a scene requires breaking a rule, stop and propose a canon amendment in the story bible first.

---

## Magic / Power System Rules

1. **Plasma weapons are heavy without manipulation.** A small Plasma-infused dagger weighs as much as a car to someone who cannot manipulate Plasma. Spyke took years (age 6-11) to lift his broadsword. No character may casually pick up a Plasma weapon without training or innate ability.
2. **Plasma Gloves manipulate elements, not raw Plasma.** Gloves mix Plasma with atmospheric elements (fire, water, wind, earth, thunder) to create effects. They cannot conjure pure Plasma on their own.
3. **Monsters can only be destroyed using Plasma.** Conventional weapons are useless. All effective combat requires Plasma-infused weapons, sword art, or elemental magic.
4. **Sword Art is cast from Plasma weapons.** Plasma beams, elemental slashes, and iaijutsu techniques all require a Plasma-infused blade. Sword art range is limited by the user's Plasma manipulation skill.
5. **Elemental Sword requires a caster and a swordsman.** Draster (or another mage) imbues Spyke's blade with an elemental property. The swordsman cannot self-imbue without a mage.
6. **Combined spells require multiple casters.** Wind + water (used for cliff descent) requires June and Draster working in sync. One person cannot do both.
7. **Blood of the Ancients grants unique powers but at a cost.** Spyke's powers (time-freeze perception, ancient voice communication, visions) are tied to his left eye, which bleeds and causes debilitating headaches. This pain is not optional — it happens every time powers activate near crystals or shrines.
8. **Time-freeze is a power of the ancients.** Only those with the blood of the ancients (Morkain, Spyke) can use or perceive time-freeze. Others are frozen completely and unaware. Spyke can perceive but moves in slow motion — he cannot match Morkain's speed within the freeze yet.
9. **Healing magic cannot fix everything.** Zena's leg wound "could not be healed with magic." Physical trauma from certain sources (crystal energy, comet radiation, etc.) requires conventional treatment.
10. **Adrenaline Mode is triggered by extreme rage/determination.** Spyke's eyes turn red, his speed and power increase dramatically. It is not consciously controlled — it activates instinctively.

## Technology Level

1. **Year 3031 Earth:** Hover vehicles, AI-driven buses, mobile phones, advanced construction, Plasma energy grid. Civilisation built on towers above flooded surface.
2. **Terra:** Mix of medieval and advanced tech. Hover vehicles exist but are expensive. Airships are the primary long-distance transport. Plasma-powered motorcycles exist (Cid's bike). Rail tunnels under construction.
3. **Weapons:** Primarily bladed weapons (swords, daggers, axes) infused with Plasma. Guns exist (June's pistol, Dobblepot's shotgun) but are less common. Translator guns exist on Terra.
4. **No spacecraft.** Terra's barrier turns anything that touches it to dust. No one has left Terra by conventional means.
5. **Communication:** Mobile phones exist on Earth. No established long-range communication on Terra. Phones can be tracked by the Formican Army.

## Power Scaling Caps

1. **Morkain is the current ceiling.** He has visited all 12 shrines and acquired their power. He can time-freeze at will, summon comets, and overpower the trio effortlessly. No character may surpass Morkain until the story explicitly permits it.
2. **Master was S-rank.** He could solo a Crystal Demon, use lightning-fast iaijutsu, and overpower Formican squads. He was the strongest character shown before Morkain, and he is dead.
3. **The trio are strong but not elite yet.** They can defeat Formican soldiers, Duke Hart, and shrine bosses, but Morkain toys with them. They cannot take Morkain in a fair fight at this stage.
4. **Spyke is the strongest of the trio.** He is the primary damage dealer with broadsword and katana. June and Draster support and can hold their own but rely on teamwork.
5. **Dual wielding limits sword art.** When Spyke dual-wields daggers/short blades, he sacrifices access to some sword art techniques.
6. **Carrying too many Plasma weapons weighs you down.** Spyke carries five blades maximum. More would drain him.

---

## Forbidden Story Devices

1. **No resurrection.** Master is dead. The Elder is dead. Dead characters stay dead. Ghosts/visions in dreams are permitted but the character does not return to life.
2. **No easy teleportation.** Characters cannot freely teleport between locations. Morkain's wind/dust disappearance is a specific ancient power. The trio must travel physically.
3. **No instant power-ups without cost.** Every power gain must come through shrine trials, training, or extreme duress. No character suddenly "unlocks" abilities without narrative justification.
4. **No omniscient heroes.** The trio constantly lack information. They learn through investigation, eavesdropping, and allies — never through convenient knowledge drops.
5. **No solo Morkain defeat (yet).** Until the story establishes the mechanism (all 12 gems, army alliance, etc.), no single character can defeat Morkain.
6. **The catastrophe cannot be "stopped" easily.** The ancients themselves failed to stop it. Any solution must be a delay, mitigation, or unprecedented approach — not a simple spell.

## Death & Consequence Rules

1. **Death is permanent.** No revival magic exists in this world.
2. **Actions have political consequences.** Attacking Formican soldiers makes the trio wanted criminals. Helping towns earns alliances. Refusing handshakes loses allies.
3. **Player decisions matter.** Key choices (shake Cannon's hand, help workers, let organiser go) affect whether allies join later. These are not cosmetic choices.
4. **Injuries persist.** Spyke's eye condition worsens over time. Zena's leg wound needed physical treatment. Battle damage carries between scenes unless explicitly healed.
5. **Collateral damage is real.** Juniper Village burned because the Formican Army was looking for Spyke. The trio's actions have unintended consequences for innocent people.

---

## Faction Behavior Constraints

1. **Formican Army:** Operates through military hierarchy. Soldiers follow orders. Dukes report to Morkain. They will track targets using sensors, phones, and crystal signatures. They do not negotiate with deserters.
2. **Morkain:** Acts strategically, not impulsively. He wants Spyke alive (for his blood/power). He will threaten but not kill the trio — yet. He kills anyone else without hesitation (his own mother, civilians, soldiers).
3. **Terran civilians:** Distrust humans due to Formican Army's invasion. Must be won over through actions, not words. Each species (elves, dwarves, gnomes, draenor, canine humanoids) has its own culture.
4. **Allies:** Only join if Spyke earns their trust through specific actions (handshakes, completing quests, making the right dialogue choices). They do not volunteer randomly.

---

## Geography & Travel Rules

1. **Terra has 5 continents** corresponding to the 5 Dukedoms: South, East, West, North, Centre (Bazzleton).
2. **A barrier envelops Terra** that turns anything touching it to dust. No leaving by air or space.
3. **Inter-continent travel options:** Airships (Formican-controlled), underground tunnels (under construction/dangerous), ocean (Formican-controlled ports).
4. **Deadbane Desert is lethal on foot.** The ground itself is dangerous — requires a levitating vehicle.
5. **Western continent is irradiated** from Morkain's comet strike on Delton. Radiation depletes health and interferes with Plasma/maps.
6. **Travel takes real time.** Walking across continents takes days/weeks. Vehicles significantly reduce this. The story must respect travel distances.

---

## Crystal & Shrine Rules

1. **12 shrines exist across Terra**, each containing a zodiac gem (Sagittarius, Cancer, Leo, Gemini confirmed so far).
2. **Only those with blood of the ancients can hear the shrine voices.** June and Draster cannot.
3. **Shrines impose debuffs** — reduced attack, reduced defense, etc. They are trials, not gifts.
4. **Taking a gem triggers a collapse** — the shrine destabilizes after the gem is removed.
5. **Black/green crystals create and control monsters.** They are separate from zodiac gems. The Formican Army uses them in machines to manufacture monsters from corpses/blood.
6. **Crystals cause Spyke's eye to react.** Proximity to black/green crystals triggers bleeding, headaches, and partial loss of control to the demon entity.
7. **The demon inside Spyke gains strength near crystals and shrines.** It has attempted to take control (Cancer shrine incident). The blood of the ancients is both gift and curse.

## Notes

- If you encounter a gray area not covered here, flag it and propose a new rule rather than making an assumption.
- Review this file after every major arc to ensure rules still serve the story.
- The relationship between zodiac gems, black crystals, and the catastrophe is still being revealed. Do not invent connections not established in canon.
