# Lore Consistency Rules — Plasma

> **Purpose:** Hard constraints the model must obey at all times. These prevent power creep, deus ex machina, and world-breaking contradictions. No draft or script may violate these rules without an explicit canon update.

---

## How to Use

When writing or reviewing any Plasma content, check every scene against these rules. If a scene requires breaking a rule, stop and propose a canon amendment in the story bible first.

- Review this file after every major arc to ensure rules still serve the story.
